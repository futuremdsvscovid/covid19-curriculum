As physicians, we must master not only the science of medicine but also the art. Module 2 touches on the impact that this disease has on a population level, and Module 3 addresses how the healthcare system is mobilizing to address the pandemic. Quite frankly, these are exceptionally stressful developments. While not everyone will become infected with SARS-CoV-19, in the setting of a pandemic, everyone is a patient. The art of medicine involves bringing that recognition to our encounters with _friends_ and _family\_as well as to \_patients_ in a direct clinical setting. Furthermore, social distancing measures impose new realities on what interactions can even look like. These changes are as good a time as any to review the communication skills that will serve us well in this uncertain time.

We’ve now discussed [**Brian and Diane**](https://docs.google.com/document/d/13JfRRw1GEIKz4JCde8WcQBCHnu-7nn11P_z0dHov1eA/edit) in the context of their medical risk and why our community benefits from all of us practicing social distancing. But knowing the facts is only a small part of effective engagement. In this module, we pivot to developing concrete tools that can help us communicate effectively with individuals like Brian and Diane.

Think of the people in your own life who may be struggling in similar ways to Brian and Diane. What makes communicating with them challenging, and how may you try to understand or support them differently?

**OVERARCHING LEARNING GOAL**

Now that you’ve bolstered your COVID-19 knowledge, prepare to productively communicate that information, especially with a non-medical audience who may have varying attitudes towards the pandemic.

 **LEARNING OBJECTIVES**

At the end of this module, medical students should be able to:

* Compare and contrast 2 different responses individuals may have to the pandemic
* Revisit 3 key conceptual frameworks for communication skills
* Recognize the tool that would be most appropriate for a given situation
* Rehearse a potentially difficult situation with someone from your life
