# Summary

We hope this module prepared you to understand PPE practice, sanitation, triaging, mechanical ventilator function,  ways to help out in clinical and non-clinical roles, and care for self and others during crisis. We recognize that this is an unsettling and stressful period of time for a duration that is uncertain. While it is important to stay informed about the pandemic, try to limit its spread, and help in ways that we can, itâ€™s also of great importance not to disregard our own wellbeing. We hope our suggestions on how to manage anxiety and promote self-care during this pandemic are helpful.

For those of you who may soon be caring for COVID patients directly, we encourage you to try out this [Virtual Patient Simulation](https://interactives.nejm.org/external/covid_simulation/index.html).
