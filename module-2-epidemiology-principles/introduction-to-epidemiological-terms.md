# Introduction to Epidemiological Terms

## Introduction to Epidemiological Terms

### Descriptors of Disease Spread

**Attack Rate/Ratio:** Refers to the \(number of new cases of disease\)/\(population at risk\) during a specified time interval. Generally, the time interval here is defined as “the duration of the outbreak”. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/csels/dsepd/ss1978/glossary.html)\)

**R0 \(basic reproduction number or “R naught”\):** Refers to the estimated contagiousness of an infectious agent and is affected by its biological features as well as human behaviors. Generally, it refers to the average number of people an infectious person is expected to infect in an entirely susceptible population \(i.e., no immunity or vaccination\). For this reason, R0 is by definition unaffected by vaccination but it can change over time and place and is not a constant of the disease \(i.e., an outbreak of a disease can have a different R0 the second time there is an outbreak in the same place if population density is higher.\). R0 can also be defined as R0= probability of transmission per contact  _contact rate_  duration of infectiousness. \([CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article)\)

**Re \(effective reproduction number\):** The same as R0 without the assumption that everyone is susceptible. Re = R0\*X, where X is the proportion of the population susceptible. Therefore, vaccination would decrease X and correspondingly the Re value. Additionally, as more people are infected with a virus, more individuals become immune to reinfection from the virus, and X decreases . When Re &lt;1, the total number of infected persons declines, and the outbreak dies out. Re=1 would keep numbers stable, and Re&gt;1 would lead to continued growth in the numbers of infected persons. Re gives an idea of transmission over time and is useful for monitoring \_during\_an outbreak, as compared to R0, which is most useful in forecasting potential severity and spread at the \_start\_of an outbreak. \([CDC](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/1/17-1901_article)\)

**Epidemic curve:** A graph of cases vs. time. Most graphs being used in articles are examples of this type of curve. Epidemic curves may be presented as the cumulative number of cases or number of new cases over time, the latter being more commonly used. It can be used to make predictions about how well interventions are working and compare across different communities. Like any graph or curve, it is only as reliable as the data it is based on. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/training/quicklearns/createepi/index.html)\)

**Incubation period:** The period of time between exposure to a pathogen and onset of first symptoms. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/training/QuickLearns/exposure/2.html)\)

**Latent period:** The period of time between exposure to a pathogen and onset of infectiousness. Note that the latent period can be shorter than the incubation period, leaving a window of pre-symptomatic infectiousness. In addition, virus transmission can happen even with a person that ultimately does not develop symptoms, known as asymptomatic infectiousness.

**Serial interval:** The period of time between symptom onsets in an infector-infectee pair. This period is often used as a proxy for **generation interval**, which is the period of time between infection of an infector-infectee pair. The serial interval helps determine the speed with which an outbreak spreads, and along with Re is a key parameter for how “steep” or “flat” an epidemic curve will appear.

**Community transmission:** Refers to transmission occurring between people within the same community. This phenomenon is separate from people acquiring the infection while traveling or due to close contact with someone who visited an area with the infection as it implies that there are unknown cases spreading the infection locally. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/community-mitigation-strategy.pdf)\)

### Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions: Containment

**Contact tracing:** An intervention in which close contacts of known cases are traced, notified of their potential exposure, and encouraged to self-quarantine. Relies on speedy testing and significant effort for each case.

**Quarantine:** An intervention that separates and restricts the movement of people who were exposed to a contagious disease to see if they become sick. Individuals can also choose to self-quarantine. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html)\) 

**Isolation:** Separation of sick people with a contagious disease from those who are not sick. Individuals can also choose to self-isolate. \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/quarantine/index.html)\)

### Non-Pharmaceutical Interventions: Mitigation

**Social distancing:** A [public health practice](https://hub.jhu.edu/2020/03/13/what-is-social-distancing/) that aims to prevent sick people from coming in close physical contact with healthy people in order to reduce opportunities for disease transmission. It can include large-scale measures like canceling group events or closing public spaces, as well as [individual decisions](https://medium.com/@ariadnelabs/social-distancing-this-is-not-a-snow-day-ac21d7fa78b4), such as avoiding crowds. The goal of these interventions is to avoid infecting high-risk populations and “flatten the curve”.

**Flattening the curve:** The concept is based on the reality that the healthcare system can only handle a limited number of sick patients at one time. Measures to “flatten the curve” attempt to slow the spread so that there are fewer cases at any one time \(however, cases are spread out over a longer period of time\) and the healthcare system is capable of providing appropriate care without being overwhelmed. Failing to do so increases the spread of the infection and the case fatality rate as the healthcare system is unable to provide appropriate care to every patient. Should improvements in treatment occur, a larger proportion of the infected population will have access to appropriate treatment. Should a vaccine be developed, more people will gain immunity that way rather than by getting sick.

_Note: flattening the curve does not necessarily mean that fewer people will become infected and require medical care in total - the area under the curve is not necessarily reduced \(even though many graphs on the Internet might suggest otherwise\)_

## W**here are we now**?

The following is a set of basic figures about the epidemic as a snapshot, which will be updated in this document as we receive new information.

Reported cases **underestimate** the total number of cases due to the incubation period, asymptomatic carriers, limited testing availability, and delays in receiving testing results after the initial onset of symptoms. The following resource is an excellent explanation of this phenomenon working from data publicly available in early March.

**CORE TEXT:** [**Pueyo - Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now. 3/10/20. Medium.**](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca)

**It is estimated that for every 1 case that is reported, there are at least 10-50 other cases that we don’t know about.** So when you hear “confirmed cases”, mentally multiply that number by 10 to have an idea of the disease incidence \([NYTimes U.S. Coronavirus Map](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/coronavirus-us-cases.html), [Lipsitch M. Presentation 3.16.20](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1VvRoIRi8GjatUhlaWh0BAYRC-yemi3pv/view?usp=sharing)\).

reported data

Overall, it seems like _\*\*_ patients infected with SARS-CoV-2 have a 1-2% chance of dying \(as of 3/16/2020\). This case fatality rate rate increases substantially with age \(see [Module 1](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo) for more information\). It is important to note that since it takes 1-2 weeks for newly infected patients to develop symptoms, there is a corresponding 1-2 week delay to see the effect of new interventions on disease infection and mortality rates.

### Asymptomatic Transmission

Recall that the **latent period**, or time from exposure to transmissibility, can differ from the **incubation period,** or time from exposure to first symptoms \(see Fig. II.1\). Several sources of evidence suggest SARS-CoV-2 has a shorter latent period than incubation period, **opening the door for pre-symptomatic transmission**. Current estimates of the SARS-CoV-2 incubation period, from initial exposure to symptom onset, range from 1-14 days with a **median of 5-7.5 days \(** [Bi et al. 03.03.2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.03.20028423v1.full.pdf); [Tapiwa et al. 03.05.2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.05.20031815v1.full.pdf)\) and 95th percentile of 12 days \([Lauer et al., Ann Intern Med 2020](https://annals.org/aim/fullarticle/2762808/incubation-period-coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19-from-publicly-reported); [Li et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001316?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)\). Meanwhile, analyses of infector-infectee pairs show a mean serial interval of 4.0 days \[95% CI 3.1, 4.9\] \([Nishiura et al, Int J Infect Dis., 3.4.20](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32145466)\) or 3.96 days \[95% CI 3.53-4.39\], widely distributed with SD of 4.75 days. Put together, these estimates imply a period of presymptomatic transmissibility. Patients may be able to transmit the virus for a prolonged period of time, , as SARS-CoV-2 RNA has been detected in patients for an average of20 days, lasting as long as 37 days \(\[Zhou et al., Lancet 2020\]\([https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736\(20\)30566-3/fulltext\#seccestitle10](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930566-3/fulltext#seccestitle10)\)\). However, detection of RNA does not necessarily indicate the presence of live virus, and it is still unclear for how many days patients remain infectious.

A difference between latent period and incubation period can lead to a period of asymptomatic communicability. The period of communicability may also extend beyond the duration of symptoms.

It is becoming increasingly clear that **most new confirmed COVID-19 cases \(an estimated 79%, from models based on data from Wuhan\) are likely spread by people that show mild or no symptoms of thedisease** \([Ruiyan et al. Science 3.16.20](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221)\). Social isolation, especially of young, healthy, asymptomatic people, will be critical to controlling disease spread.

### _Thought Question:_

How would you talk with [**Brian**](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/curriculum-overview/cases) about the importance of speedy social distancing, including with peers? \(For a more extensive dive into this task, stay tuned for [Module 4](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DSr-3wzw9eEMbfbmVtZEAMUS4C-m9Zu6FeA_CIAxi54/edit#).\)
