# Case Study: South Korea 2020

As COVID-19 cases in the US continue to rise, we can look to other countries that are farther ahead in their epidemics as sources of instruction. Of particular interest is the case of South Korea. SK is a democratic country, with largely privatized healthcare and strong corporate research presence, much like the US. Cases in SK initially grew exponentially but have flattened in recent days with extensive efforts to scale up testing, perform contact tracing, and promote social distancing, [without nationwide lockdown.](https://www.scmp.com/week-asia/health-environment/article/3075164/south-koreas-coronavirus-response-opposite-china-and) Here we present an overview of SK’s interventions.

Italy and SK had initially shown similar trajectory in the rise of cases, however, SK in recent days has plateaued**.** The US is about 1-2 weeks behind SK and Italy \(fact and figure [source](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/13/21178289/confirmed-coronavirus-cases-us-countries-italy-iran-singapore-hong-kong)\).

## Strategies for Testing

Both US and SK detected their first case of COVID-19 on Jan 20. In response, the SK government [urged](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-specialrep/special-report-how-korea-trounced-u-s-in-race-to-test-people-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN2153BW) SK medical companies to immediately develop a testing kit. [By Feb 4th,](https://www.reuters.com/article/us-health-coronavirus-testing-specialrep/special-report-how-korea-trounced-u-s-in-race-to-test-people-for-coronavirus-idUSKBN2153BW) SK approved the first testing kit, when only 16 cases had been confirmed in SK. [Rapid approval](https://www.wsj.com/articles/inside-the-south-korean-labs-churning-out-coronavirus-tests-11584610667) was possible because of the emergency use authorization policy enacted after the MERS outbreak in 2015. This cooperation between the private biotechnology sector and government led to efficient roll out of its extensive [testing capacity](https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/asia_pacific/coronavirus-test-kits-south-korea-us/2020/03/13/007f14fc-64a1-11ea-8a8e-5c5336b32760_story.html). As of mid-March, four biotech companies are producing testing kits around the clock to meet the demand, distributed to over 600 testing centers. All labs upload their results to the shared database and are reported to KCDC, which then releases daily reports detailing the epidemiologic data to the public. SK’s maximal testing capacity is ~22,000 tests per day,  administering close to 20,000 tests per day as of mid-March. **Why is extensive testing so important?** **It means that infected individuals, and contacts of those individuals can be isolated and/or treated with minimal delay. This drastically reduces opportunity for transmission, thereby decreasing Re.**

In addition to scaling up testing capacity, SK has come up with creative testing strategies to _reduce risk of contamination, reduce risk of cross transmission, increase efficiency and prioritize safety of healthcare workers._

* **Automatic testing:** Done by a diagnostic machine, rather than by a lab technician. This decreases risk of contamination, risk of transmission to healthcare workers, and allows for faster turnaround of results.
* **Drive-through testing:** Patient stays in their vehicle with recirculating air turned on, to minimize risk of transmission to healthcare workers. \(Think of it as a makeshift negative pressure vehicle.\) This method is much faster than point of care testing, because time is not wasted in disinfecting the facility and reduces risk of cross transmission. The results are texted to patients the next day. As of mid-March, SK has 43 [drive-through testing centers](https://doi.org/10.3346/jkms.2020.35.e123%20), part of more than 600 testing sites.
* **Telephone booth testing**: For those without access to vehicles. Nasopharynx and oropharynx swabs are collected while the patient is in a negative-pressure telephone booth sized room, which takes only 2 minutes to disinfect. Same advantages as drive-through testing. Link to a [video](http://www.arirang.com/News/News_View.asp?sys_lang=Eng&nseq=254358%20).

## **Strategies for Containment: Contact Tracing, Quarantine and Treatment**

With a large capacity to test individuals, SK can offer testing to individuals who have been in contact with a confirmed case, [even if asymptomatic.](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/11/opinion/letters/south-korea-coronavirus.html) When an individual tests positive, thorough [contact and location tracing](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7045882/) is done through patient interview, credit card use history, CCTV \(surveillance camera\) and [mobile phone location](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/cellphone-tracking-could-help-stem-spread-coronavirus-privacy-price). These locations are disclosed to the public and emergency [text alerts](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00740-y) are sent to those in the region, so that people can learn whether they came in contact with a confirmed case. These interventions have allowed for detection of mildly symptomatic to asymptomatic cases, which have contributed to a low case fatality rate of [0.7%](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-51836898) in SK in comparison to 3.4% global average. Determining asymptomatic carriers and isolating those individuals may be of great importance as increasing evidence [1](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc2001468?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dpubmed),[2](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/laninf/article/PIIS1473-3099%2820%2930114-6/fulltext),[3](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/13/science.abb3221) suggests that asymptomatic carriers may be a significant vector for transmission.

All identified close contacts are put under quarantine and monitored daily for developing symptoms. Those who are required to self-quarantine or self-isolate are required to download [an app](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/world/asia/coronavirus-south-korea-flatten-curve.html) that tracks their location to ensure adherence. Those violating self-isolation can be [fined](http://ncov.mohw.go.kr/en/baroView.do?brdId=11&brdGubun=111&dataGubun=&ncvContSeq=&contSeq=&board_id=&gubun=) up to 10 million won \(~8000 USD\) and up to 1 year of imprisonment. 

In addition, the government bears the cost of testing and medical care received for COVID-19. It is free regardless of immigration status, for anyone with doctor’s referral or with contact with an infected person. Those required to quarantine are provided [food and other essentials](https://observers.france24.com/en/20200305-south-korea-coronavirus-COVID-19-kits-masks) via package deliveries, paid for by the government. This decreases barriers for those in low socioeconomic status, helps curb the panic and allows for individuals to adhere to strict quarantine.

_Thought questions:_

1. What factor\(s\) may contribute to differences in case fatality rates between countries? 

## Strategy for Mitigation: Social Distancing

Using aggressive testing and contact tracing measures, SK had been controlling COVID-19 cases since their first reported case on 1/20/2020 until patient 31 who tested positive on 2/18/2020, deemed a “super spreader.” As shown in **the figure below** South Korean cases spiked after the [31st patient](https://graphics.reuters.com/CHINA-HEALTH-SOUTHKOREA-CLUSTERS/0100B5G33SB/index.html) who had attended mass religious gatherings, coming into contact with more than a thousand people. As of March 25th, this cluster accounts for 55.6% of the confirmed cases in SK. Large mass gatherings in closed confined space have led to massive increase in cases. This stresses that **public participation in engaging in social distancing is critical for reducing Re, lengthening doubling time, and thereby flattening the curve.**

Unlike China, SK has not implemented domestic travel bans, and did not immediately ban travel from China at the beginning of the outbreak. Instead of a lockdown, South Korea has focused on engaging the public to practice social distancing in addition to cancelling large events, school openings and religious gatherings. While the number of new cases have decreased consistently, there are still clusters of new cases reported. These [clusters](https://www.ijidonline.com/article/S1201-9712%2820%2930150-8/fulltext) have been attributed to large gatherings in confined rooms such as churches, call-centers \(where large groups of people work in close proximity without wearing masks so they can speak clearly on the phone\), internet cafes, hospitals, and gym facilities.

## Current Situation in South Korea

![Green bars: number of new cases per day; Blue curve: cumulative cases](https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/d_BD18j51zTM-ONvpBAQ0wqktykMFrvLbUgMvEaAY-YPWndORz8N3Xl3Yrt8M3tTauXx2XNx8VogRB7jaol8QFI2d7ZVyD1XuDmsO0ujbiJDQMKQJEcoPTLgMVacQJcjGrjHc-N_)

**As of March 25, 2020** \(source: [KCDC](https://www.cdc.go.kr/board/board.es?mid=&bid=0030)\)

As evidenced by the figure above, numbers of new cases per day have been consistently declining and stabilizing. The slope of the cumulative curve has been decreasing, no longer showing exponential growth pattern, suggesting that SK may have been successful in reducing Re. While SK's health minister has said he is hopeful that SK has passed the ‘[peak](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/09/asia/south-korea-coronavirus-intl-hnk/index.html)’ of the outbreak, it remains to be seen whether this depression is temporary. As stated earlier, the majority of the population has not been infected and therefore remains susceptible. This is particularly challenging given [differences](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/mass-testing-school-closings-lockdowns-countries-pick-tactics-war-against-coronavirus) in intervention across countries responding to this pandemic, such that the risk of reintroduction from different locations persist. How SK adapts its control measures to respond to new infections will be a useful case study for other countries.

## Summary

South Korea and other Asian countries experienced the [MERS outbreak in 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5840604/), which contributed to increased [preparedness](https://www.lawfareblog.com/lessons-america-how-south-korean-authorities-used-law-fight-coronavirus) for this pandemic. Although more time and monitoring is needed to determine whether SK has been able to suppress the COVID-19 outbreak, current trends suggest that their strategies of public transparency, civic awareness and responsibility, cooperation of the private sector and the government, decreasing barriers, and widespread testing has led to slowing the outbreak.

_Thought Questions:_

1. What strategies to reduce disease spreading and case fatality rates can we implement here in the US?
2. How could we advocate to increase preparedness for the next pandemic as future physicians?
