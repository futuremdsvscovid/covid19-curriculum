# Translations

## Introduction

Since the creation of the curriculum, we have been fortunate enough to receive numerous requests to translate it into other languages.  We are delighted to work with collaborators from different countries to expand our materials' educational reach.  We are especially grateful for our colleagues at [Oli Health Magazine](https://www.olihealthmagazine.com/covid19/homepage) who have contributed a number of these translations.
