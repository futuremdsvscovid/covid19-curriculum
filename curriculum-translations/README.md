# Curriculum Translations

## Introduction

Since the creation of the COVID Curriculum, we have been fortunate enough to receive numerous requests to translate the curriculum into various languages. We hope by working with collaborators from different countries and expanding the availability of the curriculum into numerous languages, we are able to also expand the education reach of the curriculum.
