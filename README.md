# Medical Student COVID-19 Curriculum

## Introduction

On March 15, a group of students at Harvard Medical School created a Response Team to organize their efforts against the COVID-19 pandemic.  They identified two main opportunities for impact: education and activism. Education efforts have resulted in this curriculum intended for the medical community and a public-facing social media campaign \(see @FutureMDvsCOVID\).  Activism work has involved coordinating ways that students can provide on-the-ground help in both the community and clinical settings. For inquiries about the HMS COVID-19 Student Response Team’s efforts, please see: [https://covidstudentresponse.org/](https://covidstudentresponse.org/)

This curriculum was entirely written and compiled by Harvard Medical School students.  This document is not an official publication of the institution. It is provided for educational purposes only and does not constitute medical advice.

While our primary audience is our classmates, we suspect the curriculum will be of use to other medical students and health professionals around the world.  We encourage you to share these materials with anyone whom you believe may benefit from them. If you are from outside the HMS community, welcome.  

We invite you to sign the [guest book](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdDgCyBO-l7qsamNhbEPznxhaDetC-dFBd4W5Tu5WC4zBWC6g/viewform) so we can track this material’s reach.

The contents in each module were reviewed for accuracy by expert faculty members at the time of initial publication.  We thank them for their attention during this particularly demanding time. However, given our constantly changing understanding of SARS-CoV-2 and the pandemic’s spread in society, the material in this curriculum will need to be updated frequently, and we cannot guarantee the accuracy of the information at any given time.  A date stamp is included at the bottom right of each page to indicate how recently the material was revisited. We plan to update content every Friday.

## How to use this curriculum

We want these lessons to be as widely helpful as possible.  Given the range of circumstances in which medical students may find themselves right now, we do not have a single approach in mind.  For those with the time, we suggest you proceed through the modules start-to-finish, ideally spaced over two or more sittings. However, for those with more urgent needs, the modules are stand-alone, and you can selectively access content on an as-needed basis.  The subsequent overarching goals, learning objectives, and table of contents may help you locate content that is most important. Many modules reference supplemental resources that may be worth accessing in the future, either in anticipation of specific patient interactions or simply to find the most current statistics of the pandemic.  Also included in this sheet are one-page summaries of each module’s key takeaways.

## Learning goals

\*\*\*\*[**Module 1: From Bench to Bedside**](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside)\*\*\*\*

Evaluate how the emerging understanding of COVID-19 pathophysiology translates to evolving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention efforts.

\*\*\*\*[**Module 2: Epidemiology Principles**](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles)\*\*\*\*

Introduce epidemiological principles underlying the current public health interventions regarding COVID-19, and evaluate how these interventions could influence the impact of the pandemic.

\*\*\*\*[**Module 3: Current Situation and Healthcare Response, in Massachusetts and Beyond**](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response)\*\*\*\*

Appreciate the complex and rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic as it stands in Massachusetts, as well as the adapting responses of the healthcare system and society as a whole.

\*\*\*\*[**Module 4: Communicating Information about COVID-19**](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-4-communicating-information-about-covid-19)

Now that you’ve bolstered your COVID-19 knowledge, prepare to productively communicate that information, especially with a non-medical audience who may have varying attitudes towards the pandemic.

**\[Module 5: Clinical Role-Specific Skills\]**

This forthcoming module will address some of the practical skills that students may require as they are called upon to fill new clinical roles.

## Cases 

To help you link this curriculum’s clinical, epidemiological, and social principles into real-world human narratives, the modules will repeatedly reference two characters.  We’d like to introduce you to them now.

### Case 1: Brian

Brian is a healthy, 22 year-old college senior in Boston who just received a 5-day notice to pack up his dorm room belongings, say goodbye to his friends, and return home. He posts on Twitter about being mad at the administration for taking such “ridiculous measures” and “ruining his senior spring.” He has been looking forward to walking at graduation with his friends all year and now the school has made it “virtual.” To celebrate these last few days of school, he goes out to dinner with his roommates and is surprised when the restaurant is basically empty. He is convinced the chances he’ll get COVID-19 are miniscule--there’s only a few dozen cases in Boston--and even if he does, he’ll be asymptomatic. People are overreacting, he thinks to himself. It’s just a bad cold, right?

He puts on a brave face, but inside he is really concerned. He doesn’t have a place to live after graduation and was planning on staying with his grandmother, Diane, until he earned enough money to pay rent. Now he’s being told he can’t move in with her because of the dangers he may pose to her. On top of that, he has no earnings, student debt, and a post-grad job that is on indefinite hold. 

The next day, he notices that a few people have commented on his insta-story from last night at dinner with his friends, reprimanding him for being irresponsible and not “socially distancing.” Brian feels like they are acting holier-than-thou and is frustrated that they don’t understand everything he is going through right now. 

### Case 2: Diane

Diane is a 72 year-old woman who has COPD, heart failure, depression, and anxiety. She’s proud to live on her own in an independent living facility for the elderly in the middle of the city. She was planning on housing her grandson, Brian, after graduation from college until he could find a place to live but she doesn’t think that is a good idea anymore given everything that is going on with the coronavirus madness. Over the last few weeks, she’s watched the news carefully, becoming more and more alarmed as the case numbers are rising. In particular, she’s heard that people who are older and have other health conditions are more at risk, and she is reminded of her late husband, who passed away last year of complications from the flu. Making things worse are her concerned children, who live across the country.  They call her and plead that she isolate herself at home. But she can’t--she doesn’t have any help, so Diane walks to her local supermarket to stock her pantry and purchase what she has heard to be necessities, including cleaning wipes, masks, and soap. At the store, her heart pounds. The home supply shelf is completely empty.
