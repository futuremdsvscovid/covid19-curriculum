# Care for Self and Others During Crisis

### Introduction

This is a time of high risk for our patients, colleagues, families, and selves. Previously in this module we’ve discussed how to mitigate the risk of pathogen exposure; here we discuss how to mitigate the risk of traumatic exposure. Just as in previous sections, we will discuss individual actions and structural interventions that support this mitigation and celebrate the strength of healthcare workers.

### COVID-19 as traumatic exposure 

We are in a time of dramatic changes to our daily lives and reevaluation of our collective sense of safety and control. For many or all of us, this time may represent a traumatic exposure. Trauma is defined by the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration \(SAMHSA\) as “an event, series of events, or set of circumstances that is experienced by an individual as physically or emotionally harmful or life threatening and that has lasting adverse effects on the individual’s functioning and mental, physical, social, emotional, or spiritual well-being” \([SAMHSA 2014](https://ncsacw.samhsa.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf)\).  
  
As caregivers, we are vulnerable both to direct effects of trauma or primary traumatization, as described above, and secondary traumatization, in which we are affected by the suffering of those we care for. This double burden is a chronic problem for healthcare workers, and will only be magnified during the pandemic. Traumatic exposures may occur at an individual, interpersonal, or collective level, as shown in the figure below. The pandemic may affect us at any or all three levels.

### **What are some of the common responses to traumatic exposures?** 

Early studies from the COVID pandemic have already documented adverse mental health effects of COVID-19 among frontline caregivers. Experiences from China suggest high rates of depression, anxiety, insomnia, and emotional distress \(depression \[50.4%\], anxiety \[44.6%\], insomnia \[34.0%\], and distress \[71.5%\]\) \([Lai et al. JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2763229?guestAccessKey=01bafe6d-fdaa-4fb2-9401-a2ed096c1284&utm_content=weekly_highlights&utm_term=032820&utm_source=silverchair&utm_campaign=jama_network&cmp=1&utm_medium=email)\). These effects were more pronounced in frontline healthcare workers directly engaged in triage, diagnosis, and treatment of COVID-19 patients. We share these data, not to distress you, but to normalize a range of reactions that is normal for caregivers to experience during the stress of the pandemic. 

Caregivers \(CNAs, interpreters, nurses, providers, trainees, transport staff - everyone who touches patient care\) may experience an accumulating burden of secondary trauma. In her book, [Trauma Stewardship: An Everyday Guide to Caring for Self While Caring for Others](https://traumastewardship.com/), LICSW Laura van Dernoot Lipsky lays out common elements of a trauma response. These are demonstrated in the graphic below, and animated in her [TED talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uOzDGrcvmus). You may feel several or all of these reactions.

Another common reaction to trauma, is that the reactions such as those outlined above, may feel similar to reactions you’ve had in the past, and may cause you to think about other times in which you felt overwhelmed or unsafe. You may feel triggered. You may fight, flight or freeze. These reactions refer to your “window of tolerance” within which you can emotionally regulate. Trauma exposure may cause you to fight or flight \(hyperarousal\) or freeze \(hypoarousal\). This concept is illustrated by the figure below. It is important to recognize when you might be feeling this way. We have included some grounding techniques in the next section to help get you through the moment.

Equally as important as acknowledging the losses associated with the pandemic, is highlighting the opportunities it provides for strength and growth. The figure below from the [ECHO Project](https://www.echotraining.org/trauma-trainings/) highlights 5 domains of post-traumatic growth: personal growth, closer relationships, greater appreciation for life, new possibilities, and spiritual development.

It is important to call out the fear and anxiety we are experiencing collectively, while also celebrating our strength as a helping profession.  Even the simple act of reading through this module demonstrates your strength and commitment to staying well. By labeling the experience as traumatic, we are able to draw on the trauma-informed care \(TIC\) literature for guidance on how to care for ourselves.

### **What can we do to mitigate the adverse impact of trauma on ourselves, our colleagues, and our patients?** 

Trauma-informed care \(TIC\) is a strengths-based model developed to mitigate the health effects of trauma and is based on the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration’s \(SAMHSA\) six principles \(see figure below\) including: safety; trustworthiness and transparency; peer support; collaboration and mutuality; empowerment, voice, and choice; and attention to cultural, historical, and gender issues \([SAMHSA 2014](https://ncsacw.samhsa.gov/userfiles/files/SAMHSA_Trauma.pdf)\). You may be familiar with trauma-informed care as a clinical model. The six principles you apply to patient care can also be used reflectively, for self-care, a practice referred to as trauma-informed self care \(TISC\). Here we apply the 6 principles to ourselves, our colleagues, and our institutions. The principles will be bolded throughout to highlight this framework.

_Thought Question:_ 

Think about a time you felt overwhelmed. What were some of your strengths in dealing with the situation?
