If you need support or know someone who does, contact the Disaster Distress Helpline \(call 1-800-985-5990\) or the National Domestic Violence Hotline \(1-800-799-7233\). 

**Take a break from news about COVID-19 to relax.** 

While it is important to stay informed, reading or watching information about COVID-19 all the time can be overwhelming and can contribute to feelings of stress and anxiety. Know that it is okay to take a break from news. Limit yourself to updates a few times a day. Limit the sources of news that you consume, using sources that you trust. During your breaks, take time to check in with yourself about how you are feeling. If you’d like some background music while you relax, NPR has a playlist of soothing music that is over 6 hours long: [https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815457669/isle-of-calm-stream-6-hours-of-soothing-music](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815457669/isle-of-calm-stream-6-hours-of-soothing-music)  

**Stay active.** 

Though it is best to refrain from going to the gym to limit the spread of the virus, there are still ways to be active while practicing social distancing. Medicine in Motion publishes workouts every day at: [https://medmotion.org/covid-19-workouts/](https://medmotion.org/covid-19-workouts/). These workouts can be done at home with limited equipment, and you can connect with friends over video chat platforms to work out together.   


Additionally, Down Dog apps, including Down Dog, Yoga for Beginners, HIIT, Barre, and 7 Minute Workout are completely free to download until April 1, and access will remain free until July 1 for all students, teachers, and healthcare professionals. To access the free membership go to: [downdogapp.com/schools](https://www.downdogapp.com/schools) or [downdogapp.com/healthcare](https://www.downdogapp.com/healthcare).   


However, remember that it is okay if you do not feel like being active on some days. Being active looks different for everyone. It might be working out intensely, or it might simply be going for a walk. Do whatever activity you feel is best for your health and well-being.  


**Connect with friends.** 

Social isolation doesn’t mean that you can’t still spend time with your friends. Catch up with friends over lunch, during a walk, or while relaxing over online video platforms. Make a list of television shows, music, recipes, cute animals, or other forms of entertainment that you can share among your friends. You can even watch Netflix with friends by going to [https://www.netflixparty.com](https://www.netflixparty.com) and adding a chat box in Google Chrome when watching so you can chat with your friends about your favorite shows and movies.   


**Do the activities that bring you joy.** 

Make a list of self-care activities that you enjoy, such as painting, baking, or taking naps, and allocate time in your schedule to do these activities. Be creative about doing the things you enjoyed before social isolation. For instance, you can still [visit museums virtually.](https://artsandculture.google.com/partner?hl=en&tab=pop)  


**Relax and reflect.**

This is an unprecedented time, surely one that will be remembered. Take the time to reflect on how you are feeling and what you are experiencing in whatever way you find can best capture your thoughts and feelings. If you would  like to reflect in solidarity with other Harvard Medical and Dental Students, you can contribute to the [COVID-19 Reflection Blog](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/13/815457669/isle-of-calm-stream-6-hours-of-soothing-music).  


_Thought questions:_

What are some self-care practices or strategies that you will employ during the COVID-19 pandemic?

What are some creative ways that you can connect with friends and family while social distancing?  


**Self-care is necessary for good patient care.**

All that said, it will be especially important to practice self-care if you find yourself working in a clinical setting, as well.  While it may not be possible to employ the previous methods, consider a few practices that may still help you manage the stresses of your daily work, including mindfulness and other approaches to stay connected to a sense of service for what you are doing.
