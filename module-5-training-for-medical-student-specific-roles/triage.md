# Triage

**Criteria for Testing**

Testing capacity has been in flux \(see [Module 3: Testing Capacity](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/testing-capacity-and-eligibility) for updates\), with resultant changes in testing eligibility protocols. The Massachusetts Department of Public Health \(MA DPH\) publishes  updated guidelines with criteria for COVID-19 testing \(see below for version as of 4/2/2020\). It differentiates between populations recommended to be tested at state versus commercial laboratories.

### **Remote Screening**

Screening can occur remotely through a telephone/virtual visit by guidelines similar to above. Drive-through testing sites are expanding across the country, [including Massachusetts](https://cvshealth.com/newsroom/press-releases/cvs-health-expands-rapid-covid-19-drive-through-testing-sites-massachusetts), and often require that patients fill out [an online screening assessment](https://www.cvs.com/minuteclinic/covid-19-testing) to determine eligibility. With in-house testing increasing at hospitals, institutions are developing their own testing eligibility protocols \(see below\). The Cleveland Clinic has produced [an online tool](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/landing/preparing-for-coronavirus?utm_campaign=coronavirus-url&utm_medium=offline&utm_source=redirect&utm_content=coronavirus-url&_ga=2.212126743.2068788212.1584840182-1300742023.1582059042)  allowing patients to self-assess for infection risk, with care recommendations based on risk level. 

### Triage Guidelines by Hospital

Testing: Hospitals have generally been outlining testing criteria for ambulatory vs emergency department or inpatient settings. Partners-specific guidelines are available [here](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus) \(note: requires Partners credentials\). BILH [provides guidelines on their website.](https://covid-19.bilh.org/covid-19-materials/) Of note, most protocols are initially symptom-based \(except for select populations such as transplant patients or requiring urgent airway surgery\), followed by a prioritization list for symptomatic patients or staff. These reflect a balance of clinical/operational needs for testing and resource availability. 

Clinical Triage: For a discussion of clinical triage guidelines, see [Module 1: Triage Guidelines. ](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/management-of-covid-19#triage-guidelines)

_Thought question:_

* For a low-risk patient who may not fall under the recommendations to get tested for COVID-19, but who does want to get tested, how might a healthcare worker navigate the conversation about the utility of testing amongst those at highest risk?
