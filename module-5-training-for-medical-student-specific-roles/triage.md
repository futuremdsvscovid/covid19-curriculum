# Triage

## Criteria for Testing

As also described in [Module 3](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H8CifsQN01rCvN7JkeuX0YmxCC7BKxsF9JpC-j9HV0o/edit#), the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \(MA DPH\) released guidelines outlining criteria for testing of COVID-19 on March 13. The screening eligibility combines symptoms, influenza testing, and epidemiological risk factors. The MA DPH guidelines are depicted here: 

NOTE: These criteria may change as testing availability changes \(these guidelines were published before many commercially designed kits were available, for example\).

## Remote Screening

Screening can occur remotely by telephone/virtual visit by guidelines similar to above. Exact triage protocol varies by hospital \(see below\). Cleveland Clinic has produced [an online tool](https://my.clevelandclinic.org/landing/preparing-for-coronavirus?utm_campaign=coronavirus-url&utm_medium=offline&utm_source=redirect&utm_content=coronavirus-url&_ga=2.212126743.2068788212.1584840182-1300742023.1582059042)  allowing patients to self-assess for infection risk, with care recommendations based on risk level. 

## Triage Guidelines by Hospital

Hospital Guidelines vary by site but broadly follow the Massachusetts Department of Health Guidelines described above. Partners-specific guidelines are available [here](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus) \(note: requires Partners credentials\). BILH [provides guidelines on their website](https://www.bilh.org/covid19-information-assets) for ambulatory, emergency department, and inpatient settings.

_Thought question:_

* For a low-risk patient who may not fall under the recommendations to get tested for COVID-19, but who does want to get tested, how might a healthcare worker navigate the conversation about the utility of testing amongst those at highest risk?
