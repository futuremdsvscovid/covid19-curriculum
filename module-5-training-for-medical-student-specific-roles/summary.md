# Summary

We hope this module prepared you to understand PPE practice, triaging, mechanical ventilator function, and ways to help out in clinical and non-clinical roles. We recognize that this is an unsettling and stressful period of time for a duration that is uncertain. While it is important to stay informed about the pandemic, try to limit its spread, and help in ways that we can, itâ€™s also of great importance not to disregard our own wellbeing. We hope our suggestions on how to manage anxiety and promote self-care during this pandemic are helpful.

If you have completed all of our modules to date, congratulations, and thank you for your attention!
