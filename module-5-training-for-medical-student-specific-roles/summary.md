# Summary

We hope this module prepared you to understand PPE practice, triaging, mechanical ventilator function, and ways to help out in clinical and non-clinical roles. We recognize that this is an unsettling and stressful period of time for a duration that’s uncertain. While it is important to stay informed about the pandemic, try to limit its spread, and help in ways that we can, it’s important not to disregard our own wellbeing. For suggestions on how to manage anxiety and promote self-care during the pandemic, check out our [Module 5: Supplementary Information](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1bCEmruPePVoAe1CzY-g4Uuky-e5lOiCVJ4ywWL-X0jQ/edit#heading=h.xjwt1wf02svl).
