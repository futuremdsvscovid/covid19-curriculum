# Staff

## **Overview**

The first component of the 4 S framework that this module focuses on relates to “staff." We discuss this topic in relation to task shifting, community health workers, and telemedicine. During peak surges of COVID-19 cases, human resource constraints are pronounced. Innovative solutions to expand the number of healthcare workers available to care for COVID-19 patients are being actively investigated.

## **Task Shifting**

One mechanism employed in resource-limited settings for increasing the effective number of clinical staff available to treat the health demands of a population is task shifting. This is relevant in the context of COVID-19 as systems from all income levels have exhibited strain in terms of their health care worker capacity to adequately treat the surge of COVID-19 patients in addition to non-COVID-19 patients over the course of the pandemic. The [World Health Organization](https://www.who.int/healthsystems/TTR-TaskShifting.pdf?ua=1) defines task shifting as, “the rational redistribution of tasks among health workforce teams… from highly qualified health workers to health workers with shorter training and fewer qualifications in order to make more efficient use of the available human resources for health.” The WHO recommends that task shifting be undertaken in parallel with efforts to strengthen the healthcare workforce capacity and only after consultation with relevant stakeholders, including patients, to ensure needs are appropriately met. Per the [WHO guidelines](https://www.who.int/healthsystems/TTR-TaskShifting.pdf?ua=1), successful implementation of task shifting requires knowledge of four things:

1. the available human resources for healthcare
2. the gaps in care provision
3. the extent to which task shifting is already taking place
4. existing quality assurance mechanisms

Task shifting is typically regulated by existing institutions \(e.g. licensing boards, professional societies, local, state, and national governments\). Regulations can be modified to allow extension of the scope of practice or creation of new cadres within the healthcare system. Existing training and quality assurance programs may be modified to ensure that roles and core competencies are clearly defined for new or expanded positions. Furthermore, supervision by healthcare workers with higher levels of qualification is essential \(e.g. anesthesiologist supervises multiple nurse anesthetists\). In this way, more highly qualified healthcare workers are available for cases requiring a higher level of skill or expertise. Finally, essential health services cannot be sustainably provided on a voluntary basis, so it is [important to ensure workers are compensated](https://www.who.int/healthsystems/TTR-TaskShifting.pdf?ua=1) and programs are adequately financed.

### **Examples of task shifting in COVID-19**

By mid-March, Italian hospitals were witnessing surges of COVID-19 patients that overwhelmed their existing capacity. As one mechanism to address the insufficient supply of care providers, Italy [expedited graduation for senior medical students](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/30/europe/italy-young-doctors-coronavirus-intl/index.html) so that they could serve where need was greatest. Italy also requested that all Italian doctors who had completed their education in Italy and were practicing abroad return to Italy to work.

_Thought Question:_ 

* Which of these policies from Italy incorporated task shifting? What tasks were shifted, and what qualifications were waived?

As the COVID-19 burden grows exponentially in the U.S., multiple measures have been enacted to shift COVID-19 patient care to individuals with less training and fewer qualifications. In New York, the current epicenter of the outbreak in the U.S., an Executive Order from the Governor of New York has [relaxed a number of restrictions](https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/no-20210-continuing-temporary-suspension-and-modification-laws-relating-disaster-emergency) on health professionals’ scope of practice. This order allows nurse anesthetists, physician assistants, specialist assistants, and nurse practitioners to practice without the supervision of a physician. In addition, the state has allowed nurses to order testing for COVID-19 without the need for a signed order from a physician. Plans have also been developed to [create ICU teams from non-critical care attending physicians and housestaff](https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/em/icuce-tool.pdf) to meet surge demand. Attending physicians and residents at high risk for severe COVID-19 have been furloughed and serve as “virtual rounders” who assist with hospital documentation tasks including progress notes and discharge summaries. Medical schools in New York and Massachusetts have [accelerated graduation of 4th year medical students](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/health/coronavirus-medical-students-graduation.html) and distributed emergency 90-day limited licenses, with plans to increase the number of licensed providers available to care for COVID-19 patients. Early graduation in the U.S. [has been implemented in the past](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/itching-get-back-medical-students-graduate-early-join-fight), during the 1918 Influenza pandemic, and during World War II.

_Thought Question:_ 

* How would you organize an ICU team from a group of doctors, nurses, mid-level providers, clinical assistants, and technicians who have not worked in an ICU before? Who would provide immediate and ultimate supervision of each member of the team?

## **Community Health Workers**

A community health worker \(CHW\) is a community member identified as a point of contact for health needs at the local level, helping to provide basic health and medical care within their own community. Though the terminology of a CHW varies by context \(e.g., health worker, community health promoter, etc.\) and [scopes of practice differ across settings](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3260896), they are generally capable of providing preventive, promotional, and rehabilitative care within their own community.

In many LMIC settings that have historically lacked sufficient medical personnel to meet population health demands, CHWs have helped to fill a crucial gap in their health systems. Compensation for CHWs fulfilling this role varies by context, with some countries opting to provide a salary while others provide recognition for their service while also offering certain incentives such as access to health insurance, mobile phones, and so forth. Further, some level of standardized training is generally offered to ensure that CHWs are equipped to perform their expected duties.

### **CHWs in the COVID-19 response - Rwanda case study**

Given this general overview of CHWs, we now provide a case study for how Rwanda - a country of 12 million people in Sub-Saharan Africa - has utilized its CHW network for the COVID-19 response. As some background, much has been written about the growth of Rwanda’s [CHW program](http://www.chwcentral.org/sites/default/files/Rwanda%20-%20Rwanda%27s%20Community%20Health%20Worker%20Program.pdf) in light of the gaps it helped to fill following the devastating 1994 Genocide against the Tutsi. To date, there are more than 45,000 CHWs operating at the village level who provide the first line of health service delivery. In Rwanda, villages comprise between 100 and 200 households. There are [three CHWs in each village](https://dash.harvard.edu/bitstream/handle/1/14065527/4320528.pdf?sequence=1&isAllowed=y): a male-female CHW pair \(called binômes\) providing basic care and integrated community case management \(iCCM\) of childhood illness, and a CHW in charge of maternal health, called an ASM \(Agent de Sante Maternelle\). While CHWs are elected by the members of their village, this position is voluntary and considered to be an honor in Rwanda. CHWs are also provided a series of incentives, including access to the national community based insurance scheme \(_Mutuelles de Sante_\), tools such as a mobile phone for communication \(as well as airtime\), access to CHW co-operatives, and training by the Ministry of Health. Further, the CHWs receive a nominal amount of financial support through the country’s performance-based financing program.

Due to the distribution of CHWs throughout Rwanda, they are the first people to be contacted at the local level by any person with suspected symptoms of COVID-19. Once a CHW becomes aware of a suspected case, they use SMS \(with phones provided for their role\) to contact coordinating health officials, who then alert those responsible for contact tracing so that containment efforts are optimized. Also, SMS alerts sent by CHW are integrated into a national health information technology \(HIT\) system that allows for real-time national information sharing, which in turn allows smooth coordination by regional and national authorities. The advantage of an SMS-based system is that it is a practical, rapid method for CHWs to notify health officials of emerging cases in real-time. Because the Ministry of Health pays the cost linked to the telephone communications, there are no financial charges incurred by the CHW. Further, the system is not reliant on having a stable internet connection in remote areas, thereby helping to ensure a rapid notification system across the entire country.

### **Leveraging the CHW model to expand capacity in COVID-19 response**

Though Rwanda and many other countries had robust CHW programs prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, and is ready to integrate any new threat at community level, settings that have not historically relied on a cohesive CHW structure can draw important lessons from these settings as they recruit community members for their own COVID-19 response, a health network that may be worth sustaining well beyond the current crisis.

As seen in [Table 1](http://lastmilehealth.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Prevent-Detect-Respond-Rapidly-expanding-healthcare-teams-through-community-health-workers-in-the-fight-against-COVID-19.pdf), CHWs can build on their previous tasks in their community to contribute to the COVID-19 response in a variety of ways--particularly in the detection and tracing of suspected cases; education about prevention, quarantine, isolation, and lockdown protocols put in place by public health officials; and continuing chronic disease care. In the U.S., community health care centers have drastically reduced in-person appointments to adhere to social distancing and stay-at-home orders. In some settings, these staff have been redirected to COVID-19 clinical teams, responding to high-risk patients over the phone. CHWs can assess risk for patients and provide appropriate escalation of care. One example, from Boston University, involved training [CHWs for HIV care teams](https://targethiv.org/chw), where they formed an essential bridge between healthcare organizations and communities. [Partners in Health](https://www.pih.org/article/pih-partners-mass-governors-office-covid-19-response) has also been tasked with developing a CHW workforce to improve contact tracing within the state of Massachusetts by the governor’s office. In the United Kingdom, a model has been proposed to [train CHWs to support people in their homes or virtually](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930735-2/fulltext) by assessing food and medication supplies and other needs for vulnerable people. In summary, a novel CHW program serves as a promising method to redistribute human resources in strained healthcare systems that lack adequate capacity for the surge in demand.

## **Telemedicine**

As a final example of how to increase “staff” in the setting of COVID-19, we focus on telemedicine. This mechanism for interacting with patients virtually is not a new technology; its implementation has been variable for multifaceted reasons. Below, we provide a general overview of telemedicine, advantages and disadvantages of this technology, and how regulation relaxations have been implemented to promote its use in the COVID-19 response.

### **Providing care or triage without increasing transmission risk**

Prior to COVID-19, the U.S. had witnessed [varying degrees of telemedicine utilization](https://aspe.hhs.gov/system/files/pdf/206751/TelemedicineE-HealthReport.pdf) due to complex regulatory, policy, and reimbursement challenges. However, in the setting of the pandemic, federal and state policy [increased reimbursement mechanisms](https://www.ajmc.com/journals/issue/2020/2020-vol26-n4/incorporating-telemedicine-as-part-of-covid19-outbreak-response-systems) to ensure that telemedicine could be employed as a mechanism for patients to continue seeking care without having to physically attend appointments. For instance, [Jefferson Health](https://www.aamc.org/news-insights/delivering-more-care-remotely-will-be-critical-covid-19-races-through-communities) in the U.S. has increased their telemedicine visits from a few dozen per week to 500-600 visits per day, a tenfold surge in demand for screening. The U.S. Congress recently passed the [CARES Act](https://www.congress.gov/116/bills/hr748/BILLS-116hr748enr.pdf), which will allow Medicare reimbursement for health centers and rural health clinics for the remainder of the crisis and for expansion of telemedicine. In the U.S., HIPAA \(a law that provides protections for personal health information among many other things\) compliance guidelines for telemedicine have been relaxed. It is now possible to use free or low-cost video communication tools such as Apple FaceTime, Facebook Messenger, Skype, and Zoom. Major limitations include access to a device with audio and camera, and education in using electronic platforms, which may disproportionately affect patients who lack access to this technology. Additionally, guidelines on what will require an in-person visit must be developed--for example, a change in condition, requiring a physical exam, or lack of interpreters \(although remote phone interpreters have helped to fill this last gap\). While there are logistical concerns, patients with difficulty in transportation or accessibility to attend in-person visits may benefit from this rise in telemedicine.

To provide an example from another context of how telemedicine has been utilized in the face of the COVID-19 pandemic, we provide a case study from the Philippines.

![Lung Center COVID Ask Force Online Consultations](../.gitbook/assets/1.png)

As the number of COVID-19 cases grows in the Philippines and strains its health sector, several medical groups and physicians have created a [Facebook-based platform for online consultation](https://www.facebook.com/COVIDAskForce/) services called the “**Lung Center COVID Ask Force.”** It primarily aims to triage patients with possible COVID-19-related complaints. Every Monday to Saturday, around 625 volunteer doctors, with the help of student volunteers from the Ateneo School of Medicine and Public Health, provide online consultation services to the first 1,000 patients who message the Facebook page that day. Additionally, the Lung Center COVID Ask Force also posts infographics based on frequently asked questions. These serve as educational materials that people can easily access without needing to consult a doctor.
