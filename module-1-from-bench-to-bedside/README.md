## Introduction

The Coronavirus Disease 2019 \(COVID-19\) pandemic has had massive, overarching ramifications for our global population. This is an unprecedented time for our healthcare system, and as medical trainees ourselves, we felt an obligation to synthesize the growing literature and educate our peers. This first module, written by students for students, is designed to walk you through the disease characteristics of COVID-19, including the basic virology of SARS-CoV-2 \(the etiologic agent of COVID-19\) and clinical knowledge to date. We hope that a deeper understanding of the pathophysiology of the virus, including its structure, transmission, and host immune defenses, will allow you to critically engage with evolving diagnosis, treatment, and prevention efforts. Throughout, we will highlight areas of ongoing investigation and innovation, from bench to bedside. This information will help you tackle the subsequent modules which discuss epidemiology \([Module 2](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles)\), the current situation and healthcare response \([Module 3](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response)\), and communication with the general public \([Module 4](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-4-communicating-information-about-covid-19)\). We expect that this module will take 2 hours to complete.

## Learning Objectives

At the end of this module, medical students should be able to:

* Relate the basic virology of SARS-CoV-2 to evolving COVID-19 diagnosis and prevention approaches
* Translate knowledge of the host immune response against SARS-CoV-2 to COVID-19 risk stratification, treatment, and vaccine strategies
* Build a differential diagnosis for COVID-19 using its typical clinical manifestations, laboratory, and imaging findings 
* Evaluate current triage and treatment recommendations for COVID-19, stratified by disease severity
* Appreciate how COVID-19 pathophysiology underlies ongoing research into investigational therapeutics and vaccines
