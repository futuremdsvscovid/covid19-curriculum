# Management of COVID-19

## Clinical Course

The clinical course of COVID-19 is highly variable. For patients who progress to more serious disease, clinical outcomes include sepsis, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome \(ARDS\), heart failure, coagulopathy, septic shock, acute cardiac injury, acute kidney injury, secondary infections, hypoproteinemia, and acidosis \([Zhou et al., Lancet 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/action/showPdf?pii=S0140-6736%2820%2930566-3)\). For information regarding some of the definitions of these clinical syndromes please reference the [supplemental material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWujt6g1iNUAAPeOFjSP8YFaK_C48SSO_2iz0BcQi4/edit#heading=h.azv3td120yyv), section clinical course. The role of cardiac injury in disease progression remains unclear at this time; however, acute cardiac injury and fast-onset heart failure with reduced ejection fraction \(HFrEF\) may be playing an important role in the death of certain patients.

 In severe cases, the timeline of illness progression is also variable with time from onset of symptoms to severe manifestations \(including pneumonia and ARDS\) ranging from 8 days - 2 weeks. This progression is visually represented by the slide below from Partners ID Grand Rounds Presentation summarizing the available literature on disease course \([Richterman and Meyerowitz, Partners ID Grand Rounds 3/25/20](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1shQ8m7kX2qFyj6PByY_DxM37fcyxLjSBojmTpFJN4kU/edit?usp=sharing)\). . This demonstrates the late worsening or possibly biphasic course seen in numerous cases thus far \([MGH Grand Rounds 3/12/20](https://externalmediasite.partners.org/Mediasite/Play/53a4003de5ab4b4da5902f078744435a1d); [Holshue et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191); [Huang et al., Lancet 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930183-5/fulltext)\).

![\(Richterman and Meyerowitz, Partners ID Grand Rounds 3/25/20\)](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/jE86vXWXwE5_LDoXcQ3GVLfyYy1Kfz5gO6K5AWdQk8ESk6Cc-RUynbxQl1P1LJQesvOKiCYgUMR5lEmC9C4purBfY5w29VBox5kZYQWF2nd7wY4GkuC5XQfr5SYj4o8mRFPMFbV3)

Overall case fatality rate \(CFR\) is difficult to discern because we are, for the most part, testing patients with more severe disease. The oft-quoted 2% CFR primarily comes from the largest epidemiologic report out of China that showed an overall CFR of 2.3% \(1023/44672\) \([Zhang et al, CCDC 2020](http://weekly.chinacdc.cn/en/article/id/e53946e2-c6c4-41e9-9a9b-fea8db1a8f51)\). The numerator here is the number of deaths in this cohort, which may be an underestimate because deaths lag behind new cases\). The denominator is the number of CONFIRMED cases of COVID-19 in this cohort, which may also be an underestimate due to lack of testing of the general population and presence of asymptomatic cases. There is currently no way - particularly with how little surveillance screening is being performed - to determine the TRUE number of COVID-19 cases in this cohort or others like it, given that many patients are asymptomatic or mildly symptomatic and never present for care or testing. Of note, initial reports from Italy suggest a much higher CFR than seen in China, hovering around 8% \([Lazzerini et al., Lancet 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langlo/article/PIIS2214-109X%2820%2930110-8/fulltext)\). It is possible that this too is due to the lack of surveillance testing, but it may be due to stress on the healthcare system due to the fast expansion of the epidemic in the region. The high disparity between the numbers seen in China and the numbers seen in Italy warrant further attention as the US ramps up its response to the pandemic. An additional point from the Chinese data is that there was a large disparity between the CFR in Hubei province \(2.9%\), which include Wuhan, and outside of Hubei province \(0.4%\), suggesting that access to resources and healthcare capacity is likely playing a role in the lethality of COVID-19 and is a major driver behind the “flatten the curve” movement and recommendations \(discussed in more detail in module 2\) \([Wu et al., JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)\).

_Thought questions:_

* With such extensive variation in clinical severity, what criteria could we use to determine who to admit to the hospital? What about admission to the ICU?

## Triage Guidelines

This is one example of a triaging guideline in a fever clinic in Wuhan, China \(note that arbidol is an anti-influenza medication that is not used in the US; in the US, we may use oseltamivir instead\). This diagram is not meant to be used to guide treatment decisions, but to give an example of a method that has been used in fever clinics, triaging healthcare institutions, in Wuhan_._

\([Zhang et al., Lancet Respir Med 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS2213-2600%2820%2930076-X/fulltext)\)

The institution that you will be working at will have their own triage and treatment guidelines for emergency room providers and providers on the wards. As discussed in Imaging, the CDC and ACR currently do not support using chest x-ray or CT for diagnosis, due to poor specificity of these modalities \([ACR, 2020](https://www.acr.org/Advocacy-and-Economics/ACR-Position-Statements/Recommendations-for-Chest-Radiography-and-CT-for-Suspected-COVID19-Infection)\).

If a patient with risk of exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19 calls phone triage, presents to urgent care, or to the ED, first identify whether they have no symptoms, mild symptoms, or moderate-severe symptoms.

* Mildly ill patients have subjective or low-grade fever, dry cough, aches and pains, nasal congestion, headache, sore throat \([Kirtz NPR 2020](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/814691018/coronavirus-symptoms-defining-mild-moderate-and-severe); [WHO Department of Communication March 2020](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-%28ncov%29-infection-is-suspected)\).
* Moderately ill patients have high-grade temperatures, shortness of breath/trouble breathing, chills, profound fatigue \([Kirtz NPR 2020](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/814691018/coronavirus-symptoms-defining-mild-moderate-and-severe)\), and may have signs of pneumonia on imaging \([China National Health Commission](http://kjfy.meetingchina.org/msite/news/show/cn/3337.html)\)
* Severely ill patients have symptoms including severe dyspnea, hypoxia, dehydration \([Kirtz NPR 2020](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/814691018/coronavirus-symptoms-defining-mild-moderate-and-severe)\). Signs include RR&gt;30, PaO2/FiO2&lt;300, imaging concerning for ARDS \(bilateral lung infiltrates within the last 1-2 days\) \([Casella et al. StatPearls March 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/)\)
* Critically ill patients will have frank respiratory failure, shock, and multiorgan failure \([Casella et al. StatPearls March 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK554776/)\)

The categorization of mild, moderate, and severe symptoms of COVID-19 definitions may have overlap. The morbidity of disease should be considered on a case-by-base basis in the setting of the patient’s comorbidities and well-being as a whole.

Per the China CDC report of 72,314 cases, 81% of patients were mild/moderately ill, 14% had severely ill, and 5% were critically ill. There were no reports of deaths for patients who were mildly, moderately, or severely ill; there was a case fatality rate of 49% in critically ill patients \([Wu, McGoogan JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762130)\). 

_Thought question:_

* What questions would a clinician ask over the phone to get a sense of a patient's dyspnea or hypoxia?

### If mildly ill:

If a patient is calling on phone triage with only mild symptoms, try to assess if their symptoms can be managed with supportive care and self-isolation at home. A helpful tool for patients and providers for this determination is [https://c19check.com/](https://c19check.com/), an application made by providers at the Emory University School of Medicine.

Patients being evaluated in the ED with no symptoms or mild symptoms - who are not at risk of rapid decompensation and have reliable follow-up -  should be discharged from the ED with a set of careful return precautions, direction to self-quarantine, instruction for caregivers, and instruction for how to practice supportive care:

* Return precautions would be instruction to call a provider or 911 if they have trouble breathing, worsening symptoms, high fevers, etc. The patient should let the clinic or the 911 operator know about their current symptoms and their prior exposure to COVID-19 over telephone.
* Self-quarantine includes avoiding going to public places or events, staying at home \(preferably in a private room with a private bathroom\), wearing a face mask, and cleaning door knobs and other high touch household fixtures for at least 2 weeks after potential exposure; the decision to discontinue self-quarantine should be made with the help of healthcare providers \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html)\). Per CDC guidelines, if patients had no symptoms but tested positive for COVID-19, they can end self-quarantine a week after their positive test - if they continue to be asymptomatic \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html)\). For patients with mild symptoms, there are two strategies to discontinue self-quarantine, a test-based strategy \(only realistic when enough testing resources are available\) and non test-based strategy \(which still prevents most secondary spread\):
  * Test based strategy: All symptoms have resolved AND 2 confirmed negative results from nasopharyngeal swab molecular assays for COVID-19  - collected 24 hours or more apart \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html)\)
  * Non test-based strategy: Patients with mild symptoms who were taking care of themselves at home can end self-quarantine 3 days after resolution of all symptoms AND if it has been over 1 week since they first started having symptoms \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/disposition-in-home-patients.html)\)
* Supportive care involves making sure the patient is eating and drinking well, and taking acetaminophen for comfort and fever-reduction \([WHO Department of Communication March 2020](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-%28ncov%29-infection-is-suspected)\)
  * The effects of NSAIDS on COVID-19 disease severity remain controversial \([BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1086) News\). While the WHO \([WHO Twitter](https://twitter.com/WHO/status/1240409217997189128) 3/18/2020\) and the European Medicines Agency \([EMA Press 3/18/2020](https://www.ema.europa.eu/en/news/ema-gives-advice-use-non-steroidal-anti-inflammatories-covid-19)\) do not support the avoidance of ibuprofen/NSAIDs as there is no good evidence establishing a link between NSAIDs and worsening of COVID-19 severity. However, due to an abundance of caution, the easy availability of alternatives \(ex. acetaminophen\), and the theoretical risk that NSAIDs may pose \([Fang et al. Lancet March 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanres/article/PIIS2213-2600%2820%2930116-8/fulltext)\), many hospitals, including MGH, are avoiding NSAIDs until more definitive data emerges.

Patients with a high risk of exposure to COVID-19 or confirmed COVID-19, but with only mild symptoms, should be admitted if there is risk they will decompensate or do not have reliable follow-up. Other considerations for admission are if there are others at the patient’s residence who are at high risk of complications from COVID-19, if your patient doesn’t have access to necessary resources and personal protective equipment at home, and if your patient is unable to self-quarantine \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/guidance-prevent-spread.html)\). 

Thus far, there is very limited data for care for pregnant women with COVID-19 and for post-partum care. Routine ante-natal care continues to be encouraged. Individuals with high suspicion of COVID-19 or confirmed disease who are breastfeeding or having skin-to-skin contact with their infants should wear masks as appropriate and wash their hands before and after touching the baby. Please see the WHO clinical treatment guidelines for further details: [WHO Dept of Communication March 2020](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-%28ncov%29-infection-is-suspected).

_PPE Guidelines by the CDC_

When caring for patients with a URI of unspecified etiology or with suspected COVID-19 infection in the ED, providers are recommended to use droplet precautions \(face mask or respirator\), contact precautions, and eye protection. If these materials are disposable, they should ideally be discarded after the provider leaves the room. Patients should also be given droplet masks to wear throughout their visit if possible \([CDC COVID-19 PPE guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html)\).

Airborne precautions \(ex. N95 Masks\) should be used if providers are planning to intubate, administer HFNO or CPAP/BiPAP, or perform other procedures that may generate aerosols \([CDC COVID-19 PPE guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/infection-control/control-recommendations.html)\). In settings of PPE scarcity, please follow your institution’s guidelines; these may involve using PPE for an entire shift or reusing it unless the PPE becomes wet or visibly soiled. 

### If moderately, severely, or critically ill patients:

It is important to admit patients who are moderately, severely, or critically ill. The decision about whether or not to manage patients on the floor versus admit patients to the ICU is ideally dependent on a patient’s medical stability. ICU level care is needed for patients who are at high risk of decompensation, who need advanced ventilatory support, or who need support for 2+ systems \(neurologic, renal, respiratory, circulatory\). For patients with COVID-19, the patients at most risk for needing ICU level care are older patients and patients with comorbid conditions such as COPD, hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes mellitus \([Smith, Nielsen BMJ 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115908/)\). **The most likely need for ICU admission in this patient population is advanced respiratory support** \([Murthy et al. JAMA Insights 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762996)\). Patients should be admitted if in or at risk for hypercarbic or hypoxic respiratory failure, are having or have had recent seizures, if they are at risk for losing their airway, or if they are in shock, etc. It is also important to note whether your patient had previously noted wishes about not receiving ICU level care in an advanced directive \([Smith, Nielsen BMJ 1999](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1115908/)\).

## Treatment

The following measures are used for treatment of admitted patients who are moderately, severely, or critically ill:

* Hospitalization for routine monitoring of vitals
* Use National Early Warning Score \([Smith et al. Resuscitation 2013](https://www.resuscitationjournal.com/article/S0300-9572%2818%2930945-6/fulltext); [MDCALC](https://www.mdcalc.com/national-early-warning-score-news#evidence)\), warning scores, to predict if a patient will decompensate
* If the patient is undergoing procedures that generate aerosols \(sputum production, intubation, HFNO, BiPAP/CPAP, etc.\), isolate the patient in a single private negative pressure isolation room with HEPA filter to minimize risk of airborne transmission
  * If unable to provide airborne infection isolation room, be extremely cautious in giving patient airway devices that deliver 6L/min or more of oxygen \(if not intubated\) as this may generate aerosols \([Cheung Lancet Respir Med 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32105633), [Brewster et al. Preprint March 2020](https://www.mja.com.au/journal/2020/212/10/consensus-statement-safe-airway-society-principles-airway-management-and)\)
  * High flow nasal oxygen can give fraction of inspired oxygen \(FiO2\) up to 100% and reduces the need for intubation, but should be used with airborne precautions as it may produce aerosols \([WHO Department of Communication March 2020](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-%28ncov%29-infection-is-suspected)\)
  * BiPAP and CPAP may also generate aerosols and should be avoided if possible, or if used with caution if necessary \([WFSA Coronavirus Guidance](https://www.wfsahq.org/resources/coronavirus)\)
  * If a private room is not possible, keep 2+ feet distance between patients \([Murthy et al. JAMA Insights 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762996)\)
* If concomitant asthma or COPD, to give bronchodilators, use metered dose inhalers with a spacer instead of nebulizers due to risk of aerosolization \([Wax, Christian Can J Anesth 2020\)](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs12630-020-01591-x#citeas)
  * If patient has severe asthma or COPD, consider epinephrine and early rapid sequence intubation
* Consult Infectious Disease and Pulmonology services early if not already involved
* Conservative fluid management - defined as net fluid balance of 0mL over the first 7 days - if patient has been diagnosed with ARDS and is not hypotensive or in shock \([FACT trial NEJM 2006](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa062200)\)
* If suspecting sepsis, give empiric antibiotics \(for community acquired pneumonia vs healthcare associated pneumonia\) within 1 hour of recognition of sepsis, and then work-up source of infection
* Consider oseltamivir in flu season or if you have a high suspicion that your patient has comorbid flu
* Strongly consider advanced ventilatory support/intubation if a patient is in respiratory failure \(hypercarbic or hypoxic\); for intubation specifics, please check out this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWujt6g1iNUAAPeOFjSP8YFaK_C48SSO_2iz0BcQi4/edit#bookmark=id.q0levkbf899a)
* For summary review of ventilatory settings for ARDS treatment, please check out this [link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SsWujt6g1iNUAAPeOFjSP8YFaK_C48SSO_2iz0BcQi4/edit#bookmark=id.8ldb2jkztow5)
* If patients have refractory hypoxemia even with advanced ventilatory support, consider extracorporeal membrane oxygenation \(ECMO\) if available \([WHO Department of Communication March 2020](https://www.who.int/publications-detail/clinical-management-of-severe-acute-respiratory-infection-when-novel-coronavirus-%28ncov%29-infection-is-suspected)\)
* Treat shock with volume support and pressors

_Thought questions:_

* How do you personally balance the benefits vs risks of high flow nasal oxygen delivery? Would you use this treatment modality? In which situations?
* What signs/symptoms/imaging findings would prompt you to think about giving empiric antibiotics?
