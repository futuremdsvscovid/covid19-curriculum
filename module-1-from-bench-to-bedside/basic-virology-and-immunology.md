# Basic Virology and Immunology

## **Basic Virology**

### Introduction

In December 2019, a series of cases of pneumonia of unknown origin were [reported](https://www.who.int/csr/don/05-january-2020-pneumonia-of-unkown-cause-china/en/) in Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei province in China. The causative virus was isolated and characterized in January 2020 \([Zhou et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7), [Zhu et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)\). On January 12, 2020 the World Health Organization \(WHO\) tentatively named the virus as the 2019 novel coronavirus \(2019-nCoV\). On January 30, 2020 WHO issued a public health emergency of international concern \(PHEIC\) and on February 11, 2020, the WHO formally named the disease caused by the novel coronavirus as coronavirus disease 2019 \(COVID-19\). At that time, based on its genetic relatedness to known coronaviruses and established classification system, the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses [classified and renamed](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z) 2019-nCoV as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 \(SARS-CoV-2\). On March 11, 2020, the [WHO formally characterized](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/events-as-they-happen) the global spread of COVID-19 as a pandemic, the first to be caused by a coronavirus. 

### Classification

Coronaviruses are positive-sense, single-stranded enveloped RNA viruses with helical capsids that infect a wide range of hosts including humans, bats, other mammals, and birds. As shown in the schematic taxonomy below, coronaviruses are [classified](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41564-020-0695-z) within the order Nidovirales and are further subclassified into four genera: alpha, beta, delta, and gamma coronaviruses, of which alpha and beta coronaviruses are known to infect humans. As a family, coronaviruses most prominently include several human coronaviruses \(HCoV\) that are associated with lower pathogenicity \(HCoV-229E, -NL63, -OC43, -HKU-1\), contributing to seasonal cases of the ‘common cold’ and sometimes linked to more severe respiratory illness \([Bradburne et al., BMJ 1967](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1843247/?page=1); [Lieberman et al., Chest 2010](https://journal.chestnet.org/article/S0012-3692%2810%2960526-0/fulltext)\). Two betacoronaviruses have previously been identified to cause more severe disease and outbreaks: severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus \(SARS-CoV\), responsible for the SARS worldwide outbreak in 2002-3 with 8,096 cases and 774 deaths [reported](https://www.who.int/csr/sars/country/table2004_04_21/en/), and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus \(MERS-CoV\), responsible for 2,102 cases and 780 deaths [reported](https://www.who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/en/) during the 2012 MERS outbreak. SARS-CoV-2 falls under the betacoronavirus genus and is the seventh coronavirus identified to infect humans \([Zhou et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7), [Zhu et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/10.1056/NEJMoa2001017?url_ver=Z39.88-2003&rfr_id=ori:rid:crossref.org&rfr_dat=cr_pub%3dwww.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov)\).

### Genome

Coronaviruses have the largest genome of all ribonucleic acid \(RNA\) viruses infecting humans, consisting of a positive-sense single-stranded RNA roughly 30 kb in size that is 5’-capped and 3’-polyadenylated. Shown in the figure below, the virus genome is non-segmented and produces polyproteins initially. There are a total of 11 genes. The genome is organized with non-structural polyproteins, which are then cleaved to be enzymes such as proteases and RNA polymerase, encoded at the 5’ end and structural proteins encoded toward the 3’ end.

### Genetic relatedness to other viruses and suspected origins

The majority of new coronaviruses are isolated from bats, which serve as a natural reservoir, though other animal species have been linked as intermediate hosts in the transmission to humans, such as the civet cat for SARS-CoV \([Guan et al., Science 2003](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/302/5643/276)\) and dromedary camel for MERS-CoV \([Chu et al., Emerg Infect Dis 2014](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/20/6/14-0299_article)\). As seen in the phylogenetic trees below, SARS-CoV-2 viruses isolated globally are genetically related to SARS-CoV isolates of the 2003 SARS outbreak. Currently, the closest identified relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a virus isolated in bats \([Zhou et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-2012-7)\). It is suspected that an intermediate host may have facilitated the zoonotic event, given both overall limited interactions between bats and humans and also the initial cluster of cases which were epidemiologically linked to a live animal and seafood market in Wuhan. Among a large variety of animals present, the pangolin, a scaly anteater and commonly trafficked mammal, has been implicated as a potential intermediate host, based on high levels of similarity of pangolin coronaviruses to SARS-CoV-2 at the protein level \([Lam et al., bioRxiv preprint 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.13.945485v1)\). However, full genome analysis of pangolin coronaviruses have appeared more distinct \([Liu et al., bioRXiv preprint 2020](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.02.18.954628v1)\), suggesting that other market animals, such as civets or pigs, may have been the intermediate host between bats and humans \([Lu et al., Lancet 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930251-8/fulltext); [Zhang et al. Clin Infect Dis 2020](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa112/5721420)\).

_Thought questions:_

* Based on the phylogeny, would you expect SARS-CoV-2 to behave more like SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV?
* What are some benefits and drawbacks of analyzing specific genes compared to the whole genome of a virus?
* How might understanding the origin and intermediate hosts of a virus influence human practices and policies to prevent zoonotic viruses from seeding new epidemics?

### Virus structure

Microscopically and as seen in Figure 3, coronaviruses have club-shaped trimeric surface spike glycoproteins that give the virions the appearance of a crown, hence their name \(from the Latin corona meaning “crown”\). Summarized in Table 1 below, coronaviruses contain four major structural proteins: the spike \(S\), membrane \(M\), hemagglutinin-esterase \(HE\) in some betacoronaviruses, and envelope \(E\) all located on the membrane envelope, and the nucleocapsid \(N\) protein found in the core. The N proteins associate with the RNA genome to form a long helical ribonucleoprotein \(RNP\) packaged within the enveloped virus particle. The M protein, the most abundant of the structural proteins, is a transmembrane glycoprotein that gives the envelope its shape. The E protein is thought to be critical for coronavirus infectivity.

The S surface protein is responsible for receptor binding, host range, membrane fusion, hemagglutinin activity, and is a target for eliciting host neutralizing antibodies \([Millet & Whittaker, Virus Res 2015](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4465284/)\). SARS-CoV-2 has genetic polymorphisms in the S protein when compared to other coronaviruses that can cause lethal human disease, such as SARS and MERS coronaviruses. This different spike protein structure has suggested that protein can be activated by furin, a host-cell enzyme, found in many human tissues including lungs, liver, and small intestines \([Andersen et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-020-0820-9)\). Whereas SARS-CoV and other related coronaviruses do not have furin activation sites, potential furin activation for SARS-CoV-2 may explain its expanded cellular tropism \([Walls et al., Cell 2020](https://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674%2820%2930262-2?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0092867420302622%3Fshowall%3Dtrue)\), which may contribute to the manifestation of liver injury with COVID-19 \([Zhang et al., The Lancet 2020](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/langas/article/PIIS2468-1253%2820%2930057-1/fulltext)\).

_Thought questions:_

* How could the specific proteins \(S, E, M, and N\) on SARS-CoV-2 be useful targets for diagnosis? For treatment?
* What technologies or molecular diagnostics/therapeutics would be useful?
