# Summary

The situation around the world and here in Massachusetts is rapidly evolving, as we move from imported cases to community spread. For individuals like **Brian** and **Diane**, significant changes in day-to-day routines and long-term plans have to take place in order to protect the community as a whole. Both Brian and Diane will have to minimize trips outside their homes. Brian is disappointed he will no longer be able to eat out at restaurants with his friends, while Diane is disappointed her grandkids from across the country will no longer be visiting due to decreased air travel. Both are trying to wash their hands more often.

**Diane** worries what will happen if she develops symptoms. She knows she is at higher risk given her age and other health conditions. What might be some of Diane’s concerns around testing?

**Brian** wonders if testing would even be worth it for him, especially if he won’t get that sick. He doesn’t know anyone personally who has had symptoms, but he has been out in some large groups over the past weeks. What could Brian’s concerns be, and how might they differ from Diane’s?

**Brian** is worried about how the changing economy will impact the job he has lined up for after graduation. What are other ways Brian’s life might be impacted in the coming months?

**Diane** is worried about leaving her home for her usual book club and to volunteer at the library. How can Diane stay connected to her community? Are there programs or interventions you could imagine setting up to help her stay connected?

We hope this module helped capture the complex and rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic as it stands in Massachusetts, as well as the adapting responses of the healthcare system and society as a whole.
