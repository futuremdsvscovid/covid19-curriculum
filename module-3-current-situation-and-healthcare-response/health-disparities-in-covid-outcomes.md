# Health Disparities in COVID-19 Outcomes

## **Racial health disparities background**

### **Race as a social construct** 

The discussion on racial disparities in COVID-19 outcomes should begin with the fundamental understanding that race is a social construct rather than a biological factor \([Smedley et al, American Psychologist, 2005](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2005-00117-003)\)

### **Racial disparities in health outcomes before COVID-19**

Racial disparities in  access to health care, health outcomes, and collection of race based data predate the COVID pandemic. For an in-depth discussion of racial disparities prior to COVID, please refer to the [supplemental material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weLnZQE7LxS_Gm9pyX4Ba7ViH_7rQNH56T-1GT5dRp8/edit?usp=sharing). 

## **Racial disparities in COVID-19 specific outcomes**

Health disparities have been known to worsen health outcomes in African American and Hispanic populations. The spread of COVID-19 in the U.S. unmasked these racial disparities when data released from the[ CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/69/wr/mm6915e3.htm) demonstrated that African American and Hispanic patients are multiple times more likely to contract coronavirus and die from the disease. States or counties began to release racial data pertaining to COVID-19, and a[ pattern](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/04/coronavirus-exposing-our-racial-divides/609526/) emerged showing that African Americans and Latinos were overrepresented among the infected and the dead. News articles abounded, illuminating the tragedy that the most vulnerable populations in America would inevitably be hit the hardest by this pandemic. 

The statistics are especially alarming in cities like Chicago and Detroit, which have predominantly African American populations.  In Chicago, which is 30% African-American, deaths amongst this population represent[ 64.6%](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html) of the total deaths from COVID-19 and deaths amongst the Latinx community represent[ 11.1%](https://www.chicago.gov/city/en/sites/covid-19/home/latest-data.html) of COVID-19 deaths. In Michigan, which is 14% African-American, the number of African American deaths constitute[ 39%](https://www.michigan.gov/coronavirus/0,9753,7-406-98163_98173---,00.html) of fatalities. Detroit, Michigan, a city with the highest percentage of African Americans compared to any other large U.S. city, has emerged as a hotspot for COVID-19. Detroit is located within Wayne County, which has[ 47%](https://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/local/michigan/2020/04/02/michigans-covid-19-deaths-hit-417-cases-exceed-10-700/5113221002/) of Michigan's COVID-19 cases. 

The numbers are also stark in New York City, which has become the epicenter of the pandemic in the U.S. African Americans in New York City make up[ 28%](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/opinion/coronavirus-black-cities.html) of fatalities, while only accounting for 22% of the total population. Communities of color within New York City are more affected than others, with neighborhoods such as Corona, Elmhurst, East Elmhurst, and Jackson Heights recording more than 7,260 coronavirus[ cases](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/09/nyregion/coronavirus-queens-corona-jackson-heights-elmhurst.html) as of April 8th out of a population of 600,000. Elmhurst, a neighborhood in Queens, has been described as the epicenter of the epicenter in New York. The [preliminary death rate](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html?) for Hispanic people in New York City is 22 people per 100,000, and, for African Americans, the rate is 20 per 100,000. In comparison, the rate is 10 per 100,000 for white people and 8 per 100,000 for Asian people. In response to the data being released from New York, Governor Cuomo committed more testing to minority and low-income communities and more research to determine why these disparities exist. 

Racial disparities in outcomes have been reported in [various other states](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/07/us/coronavirus-race.html) including Louisiana, Wisconsin, Minnesota, North Carolina, South Carolina, Connecticut, Nevada, and Massachusetts. In Milwaukee, WI, a city that is 26% African American, it has been reported that nearly half of all COVID cases are made up of African Americans, who also represent[ 81% of COVID related deaths](https://www.propublica.org/article/early-data-shows-african-americans-have-contracted-and-died-of-coronavirus-at-an-alarming-rate). In Boston, MA where, African American residents account for 25% of the population, more than[ 40% of COVID infected residents were reported as black](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/09/nation/boston-releases-coronavirus-data-that-point-stark-racial-disparities-among-those-infected/?event=event12). On the other hand, the number of white and Asian residents infected with COVID was lower than expected for the proportion of the population they compose.  Though current aggregated data does not yet reflect a higher rate of infection among Latinos in Boston, medical providers in hospitals are[ reporting higher rates of hospitalization among Latinos](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/07/nation/coronavirus-may-be-hitting-hard-black-latino-communities/?p1=Article_Inline_Text_Link). It should be noted that, while the Governor Baker administration has made race-based Massachusetts outcomes public, only 62% of the data has race information. As a response to these statistics and the need to protect minority populations in Boston, the administration has created the[ COVID-19 Health Inequities Task Force](https://www.boston.gov/news/covid-19-health-inequities-task-force-created). Two other states,[ Louisiana](https://gov.louisiana.gov/index.cfm/newsroom/detail/2457) and[ Michigan](https://www.wxyz.com/news/coronavirus/whitmer-announces-task-force-dedicated-to-address-racial-disparities-during-covid-19-crisis), have created a similar task force to tackle racial disparities. 

As more race-based data is collected and reported, it is important to note that the information on many minority communities, including Native American and Pacific Islanders, is missing. The[ Indian Health Services](https://www.ihs.gov/coronavirus/) has started an initiative to aggregate up-to-date information on the infection rate among Native Americans. This data collection relies on volunteer release of data from various organizations, health centers, and programs across the country.  The [call for more accurate collection and reporting of data](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200414.238084/full/) on the health and outcomes of minority populations during COVID is being echoed by leaders in medicine, public health, and policy.

## **A Modern Day Gardener’s Tale** 

### **Framework for race, disparities, and health**

Racial disparities in health outcomes are not new to the COVID-19 pandemic, but rather are intertwined within the historical, structural, and economic disadvantages that have been created overtime in the U.S. Research has shown that African Americans, Native Americans, Hispanics, Native Hawaiians, Pacific Islanders, and Asian Americans have disproportionately worse outcomes compared to their white counterparts \([Williams, J Health Soc Behav 2012](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0022146512455804)\).  The relationship between race and health has been explained in various frameworks; one of the most well known is Dr. Camara Jones’s Gardener’s Tale, in which three levels of racism are described: institutionalized, personally mediated, and internalized \([Jones, Am J Pub Health 2000](https://ajph.aphapublications.org/doi/10.2105/AJPH.90.8.1212)\).  For a more in-depth discussion of racism through the lens of the Gardener’s Tale, please see the [supplemental material](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weLnZQE7LxS_Gm9pyX4Ba7ViH_7rQNH56T-1GT5dRp8/edit?usp=sharing). 

### Institutional racism

On an institutional level, African American and Hispanic patients are not able to socially isolate themselves, as they make up a large portion of the essential workforce. They also face reduced access to testing, inadequate treatment upon contracting the virus, and increased risk of developing serious illness due to a high prevalence of underlying health conditions. 

In response to COVID-19's spread throughout the U.S., many states have adopted social distancing measures to flatten the curve and reduce the burden on the healthcare system. However, essential workers are more restricted in their ability to participate in social distancing. Data from the[ U.S Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/news.release/flex2.t01.htm) in 2018 showed that less than 30% of workers in the U.S. are able to work from home. This number falls to 19.7% amongst African American and 16.2% amongst Hispanic workers. Many essential workers occupy front-facing roles as grocery store workers, first-responders, and public transport workers, where they are at increased risk of exposure to SARS-CoV-2. In New York City, the[ city comptroller Scott M. Stringer](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/nyregion/coronavirus-race-deaths.html?) noted that 75% of frontline workers, including grocery clerks, bus and train operators, janitors, and child care staff, were minorities. He also reported that 60% of those who worked as cleaners were Latino, and more than 40% of transit employees were African American. Essential workers are financially dependent on their jobs and often do not have access to paid sick leave and health insurance if they do not go to work. The risk is further compounded by insufficient personal protective equipment \(PPE\) amongst essential workers. Recently, food delivery workers have initiated [strikes](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/30/823767492/amazon-instacart-grocery-delivery-workers-strike-for-coronavirus-protection-and-) to protest unsafe working conditions, insufficient testing, and insufficient PPE while on the job. Once these workers return home, they are more likely to live in crowded households due to a lack of living wage and unaffordable housing, which increases the risk of exposure to family members living in the same household \([New Yorker, April 2020](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-coronavirus-and-the-interwoven-threads-of-inequality-and-health)\). Dr. Camara Jones summarized the risk that essential workers face when they go to work each day, explaining, “We are in more front-facing, low-income, under-appreciated jobs, where we are part of the essential workforce that really isn’t getting its full attention, and certainly not getting the full protection that we need” \([Newsweek, April 2020](https://www.newsweek.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-disease-discriminates-our-health-care-doesnt-have-opinion-1496405.html)\). 

COVID-19 testing is limited in availability to minority communities. Though the[ Families First Coronavirus Response Act](https://www.natlawreview.com/article/emergency-legislation-families-first-coronavirus-response-act-updated-march-26-2020) provides funding for free COVID-19 testing, tests remain limited to those deemed to have serious symptoms and, in some cases, patients have been asked to cover the cost of testing \([Time, Mar 2020](https://time.com/5806724/coronavirus-testing-costs/)\). In addition, the stimulus package does not cover all the expenses related to hospitalization for COVID-19, which means significant financial ramifications for underinsured Americans if they present for care. These factors may dissuade people from going to the hospital to get tested and deter individuals from seeking help before symptoms worsen. Further, hospitals in historically low-income communities may become[ overwhelmed](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/13/health/detroit-hospital-bodies-coronavirus-trnd/index.html) by the sheer volume of patients, which could result in less PPE for frontline staff, lower availability of medications and ventilators, and worse outcomes for patients presenting to these hospitals in serious condition. These institutional infrastructures increase the risk of exposure amongst minority patients, limit their access to testing, and disadvantage them when they present to care.

According to Dr. Camara Jones, “The ‘pre-existing health conditions’ that put a person at risk of severe disease and death from COVID-19 are over-represented in communities of color and poor communities as a result of long-term disinvestment and neglect” \([Newsweek, April 2020](https://www.newsweek.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-disease-discriminates-our-health-care-doesnt-have-opinion-1496405.html)\). African American and Hispanic communities are at increased risk of developing health conditions such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, diabetes, obesity, and lung disease due to poor access to healthcare, increased exposure to air pollution, and insufficient public health support systems. In particular, cardiovascular disease starts at earlier ages in people who belong to social groups that are subjected to discrimination and economic deprivation compared to people who belong to more privileged groups \([New Yorker, April 2020](https://www.newyorker.com/news/q-and-a/the-coronavirus-and-the-interwoven-threads-of-inequality-and-health)\). In terms of public health inequities, an alarming example is the lack of water availability in Detroit, Michigan, where residents have had their water shut off due to inability to pay rising bills. It is difficult to promote hand-washing without access to clean, affordable water, which can increase the risk of contracting infectious diseases. The[ CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/need-extra-precautions/groups-at-higher-risk.html) states that people of any age who have serious underlying conditions are at higher risk for severe illness from COVID-19 compared to people without these conditions.

### **Personally-mediated racism**

Personally-mediated racism can also lead to poor COVID-19 health outcomes. African American and Hispanic patients have cited difficulty obtaining COVID-19 testing. Tests are given at the discretions of physicians, which can introduce implicit bias. Individual bias can also mean that some physicians may not accurately calculate the risk to minority patients in deciding whether a test is warranted. There have been cases of minority patients being turned away for testing and from emergency rooms, only to decompensate later without receiving adequate treatment. Ethical questions can also be raised as to whether implicit bias plays a role in rationing scarce resources such as ventilators and experimental treatment. 

### **Internalized racism**

Finally, internalized racism can present a challenge to battling COVID-19 in minority communities. Due to repeated examples of racism throughout history, such as the Tuskegee trials and the unpermitted use of Henrietta Lack’s cells, African American and Hispanic patients may harbor distrust towards the healthcare system and its policies. This distrust can manifest as resistance to social distancing and reluctance to present for care due to fear of discrimination. In states that have[ not expanded Medicaid](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/12/coronavirus-us-deep-south-poverty-race-perfect-storm), minority communities are hesitant to present for care due to cost, an issue that has been reported in states including Alabama and Mississippi.

## Lessons for the future

Dr. Camara Jones proposes three principles for achieving health equity during the fight against COVID-19, which include “valuing all individuals and populations equally, recognizing and rectifying historical injustices, and providing resources according to need” \([Newsweek, April 2020](https://www.newsweek.com/2020/04/24/coronavirus-disease-discriminates-our-health-care-doesnt-have-opinion-1496405.html)\). Dr. Jones emphasizes the importance of enabling all communities to participate in social distancing, stay-at-home orders, and frequent hand-washing, which means providing housing for the homeless, hand-washing stations, and reaching out to communities of color to emphasize the importance of social distancing. It is necessary to collect and disaggregate data on “coronavirus testing, diagnosis, treatment, and outcome by ‘race’ and ethnicity so that the impacts of these historical injustices can be recognized and addressed.” Finally, it is important to agree upon a metric of need in a particular community, such as the number of diagnosed cases or indicators of the trajectory of the epidemic, to allocate and distribute resources according to that metric of need. Dr. Valerie Montgomery Rice urges the importance of[ concentrating resources in communities of color,](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PWGXmuDcAFA) commenting that, “At a federal level, we want to see resources deployed to the hardest hit communities, and, based on the data we are seeing, these are African American communities, Hispanic communities, poor communities.” In addition to [petitioning for national standards](https://www.ama-assn.org/press-center/press-releases/top-physician-orgs-urge-covid-19-mortality-data-race-ethnicity?utm_source=Selligent&utm_medium=email&utm_term=%25m%25d%25y&utm_content=OTHER_PE_COVID19_MEM_041620&utm_campaign=PPOS_Lifestyle_020920&utm_uid=10939166&utm_effort=&utm_h=) for reporting race outcomes in COVID, medical organizations such as the American Medical Association \(AMA\) have responded by creating a [Health Equity Resource](https://www.ama-assn.org/delivering-care/health-equity/covid-19-health-equity-resources) website. 

The data has drawn national attention. Dr. Fauci, immunologist and director of the NIAID,[ reflected](https://www.businessinsider.com/fauci-covid-19-shows-unacceptable-disparities-for-african-americans-2020-4) “...sometimes when you're in the middle of a crisis, like we are now with the coronavirus, it really does, ultimately, shine a very bright light on some of the real weaknesses and foibles in our society.” The extent of the toll COVID-19 will take on American society remains unclear, but it is key that society recognize and treat racial health disparities before they claim unnecessary lives.

_Thought Questions:_

* What are immediate and long term policies that are necessary to curb the devastation that COVID-19 is having on minority communities?
* What lessons can we learn from COVID regarding disparities in health care which can help us improve outcomes of minority populations in the long run?
* What are data points which you see are still lacking in the race based COVID outcome reports?

## **COVID-19 among correctional facilities populations** 

### Health and healthcare in correctional facilities prior to COVID**-19**

Given the United States is one of the leading countries in the number of people who are incarcerated, the health and wellbeing of this population during the COVID pandemic warrants discussion. It is estimated that[ nearly 2.3 million](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/reports/pie2020.html) individuals in the United States are currently incarcerated.  For a discussion on the state of health and healthcare in correctional facilities prior to COVID, please refer to the [supplemental reading](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1weLnZQE7LxS_Gm9pyX4Ba7ViH_7rQNH56T-1GT5dRp8/edit?usp=sharing).  

### **Incarceration during COVID-19**

As of April 13, [388 federal inmates](https://www.bop.gov/coronavirus/) have tested positive for COVID-19, of which 13 have died from the virus. This number does not represent state prisons and local jails, which have also reported COVID-19 related deaths across the U.S. At the state level, numerous reports are surfacing that report cases of COVID-19 in correctional facilities, including in[ Chicago’s Cook County Jail](https://www.npr.org/2020/04/13/833440047/the-covid-19-struggle-in-chicagos-cook-county-jail), where a federal lawsuit was opened against its lack of response to COVID-19. Correctional facilities are a particularly dangerous site for spread. First, the idea of social distancing is difficult to implement in forced confinement. Second, given the predilection of COVID-19 for older adults with pre-existing conditions, the fact that nearly[ 20% of incarcerated individuals are over the age of 50, and more than a third](https://www.bop.gov/about/statistics/statistics_inmate_age.jsp) have pre-existing health conditions puts them in a vulnerable position for serious illness from COVID-19. Reports are also showing that, in some prisons, the[ response to provide medical care](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/melissasegura/prison-inmates-covid-19-coronavirus) for incarcerated individuals with COVID-19 symptoms is slow. In Kansas,[ the outcry to receive medical attention](https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2020/apr/10/us-prisons-coronavirus-uprising-riot) resulted in an uprising within a correctional facility. It should also be noted that, in addition to the direct health effects of COVID, incarcerated individuals face additional health risks from isolation as a result of loss of privileges and visitation rights.

### Federal response

Several human rights organizations and initiatives have pleaded with the federal government to take immediate action to reduce the spread of COVID**-**19 in prisons and jails. For example, the[ Prison Policy Initiative](https://www.prisonpolicy.org/virus/virusresponse.html) has released a five point list of immediate actions, which include the following:

1. Releasing incarcerated individuals from jails and prisons \([an initiative now in action](https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-51947802) in several states\)
2. Reducing admissions to correctional facilities
3. Reducing check-ins, such as parole visits
4. Eliminating co-pays for medical care
5. Providing telephone and video calls at a lower cost

While U.S. Attorney General William Bar has[ taken some initiatives to address](https://www.themarshallproject.org/2020/03/28/how-bill-barr-s-covid-19-prisoner-release-plan-could-favor-white-people) the spread of COVID-19 in federal correctional facilities, such as ordering the use of home confinement and early release, many biases plague the current system that determines which individuals qualify for these initiatives.
