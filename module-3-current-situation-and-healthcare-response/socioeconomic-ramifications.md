## SOCIOECONOMIC RAMIFICATIONS 

As we know, illness and health have an impact on our lives and communities, and vice versa. COVID-19 is no exception--the ways we gather and interact with one another directly enable transmission of this disease, and steps to mitigate disease spread have ripple effects in our social and economic lives. While it is impossible to cover all of these ripple effects in our communities and our world, we hope this section will spark your curiosity and creativity in thinking about the mutual impacts of COVID-19, our society, and our economy. In particular, we encourage you to consider how infectious diseases and societal responses to them disproportionately impact folks experiencing:



*   Social isolation
*   Housing insecurity
*   Incarceration
*   Insecure immigration status
*   Lack of paid sick leave/ability to take time off work
*   Financial instability
*   Lack of childcare in light of school closings

Several of these effects are discussed below, with others explored in the further reading section.

**Social Isolation**

Social distancing asks us to stay physically separated from one another, which poses the risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness (social distancing still allows for other forms of social connection, mostly through technology, that can help decrease social isolation and loneliness). This risk is particularly high for elderly individuals and those already isolated. While social distancing itself has not been studied, experts on social isolation and associated negative health outcomes have begun to [weigh in](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/we-are-social-species-how-will-social-distancing-affect-us) on potential impacts social distancing may have. If you’re interested, check out [this meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910600/) on the effect of social relationships on morbidity and mortality. 

**Impact on Work**

Social distancing has become an important strategy for slowing down spread of the virus and ‘flattening the curve’. For those unable to work from home or take time off work, social distancing could mean making the choice between risking spread of the virus and not having the resources to secure food, rent, and/or childcare. As of March 17, [one in five](https://www.npr.org/2020/03/17/817158521/poll-nearly-1-in-5-households-have-lost-work-because-of-pandemic) US households had experienced layoffs or reduced work hours. [This article](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/13/21178879/coronavirus-covid-19-restaurant-workers-sick-leave-chipotle-mcdonalds) describes the struggle of food service workers whose work requires them to be public-facing, often without the option for paid sick leave. In addition, small business owners [here in Boston](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/12/covid-19-hitting-boston-area-small-businesses) are grappling with closing their doors to help with social distancing efforts, even if that means losing income.

**Financial Instability**

On a larger scale, COVID-19 is already affecting the global marketplace, and will likely continue to evolve over the coming weeks. For anyone watching the nightly news, it’s hard to ignore the market tickers at the bottom of the screen as they drop precipitously. Stocks have had some of their largest single day declines since 1987, and continue their downward trajectory. While certainly not this audience’s area of expertise, it may prove beneficial to understand the economic implications of a pandemic as its impact will be felt universally. To understand how the economy has already been impacted, please see [this article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225) from the BBC. 

The likely economic impact of this pandemic is two-fold. First, there will be a supply shock as supply chains are affected by factory closings, worker absences, and border closures. This is exacerbated by a collapse in consumer demand. On several measures, consumer confidence is already lower than it was during the financial crisis of 2008. Ongoing social distancing measures have necessarily resulted in some businesses needing to be shut down, leading to cuts to wages and hours and even layoffs. Unfortunately, our fundamental governmental levers for both fiscal and monetary policy do at some level presume that there is no shortfall in economic labor. The situation is quite challenging.

 Both supply and demand shocks are quite complex and interact in a complex manner. Structural and political mismanagement of the situation could further an economic downturn. These and other economic principles, in addition to GDP trends during other pandemics in history, are nicely outlined in [an article](https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy) from the Harvard Business review. 

**What Is Being Done in Response?**

Congress has begun to address these social and economic impacts with the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which has passed both chambers of Congress and been signed by the President. This bill includes the following (read the full text [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201/text)):



*   Expands paid sick leave
*   Provides additional funding to WIC and other supplemental nutrition programs
*   Expands requirements for SNAP
*   Mandates that COVID-19 testing will be free
*   Expands requirements around employers’ infectious disease control plans

[Additional considerations](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200312.363618/full/) and priorities put forth by experts from a variety of fields (and co-authored by HMS classmates!) include targeting protections for vulnerable groups, bolstering public health infrastructure, and enabling the rapid development of vaccines and treatments. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have expanded access to [telemedicine](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet), particularly to serve those with routine health care needs, as well as those with mild symptoms. This will minimize the number of people in clinic and hospital waiting rooms who could acquire and/or spread COVID-19 while waiting to be seen. The White House has also invoked the [Defense Production Act](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21185333/coronavirus-defense-production-act-trump), which gives the president authority to order manufacturers to increase their production of needed supplies (such as masks, respirators, and ventilators) (Module 5 will cover more on the PPE shortage in the United States). Local action has taken place around housing, with Massachusetts [suspending](https://www.mass.gov/housing-court-rules/housing-court-standing-order-2-20-temporary-modifications-to-court-operations) all non-emergent housing court proceedings (including most evictions) until April 21.

_Thought questions:_

What types of public health and health care delivery interventions introduced during this crisis have staying power, and why? (e.g. telemedicine, expansion of sick leave)

The pandemic has been described as a global phenomenon that has exposed the “Achilles’ heel” of many social and structural shortcomings. What shortcomings have you identified during this pandemic and if given the chance, how would you propose we address them after the pandemic is over?
