# Socioeconomic Ramifications

Illness and health have an impact on our lives and communities, and vice versa. COVID-19 is no exception--the ways we gather and interact with one another directly enable transmission of this disease, and steps to mitigate disease spread have ripple effects in our social and economic lives. While it is impossible to cover all of these ripple effects in our communities and our world, we hope that this section will spark your curiosity and creativity in thinking about the interconnected nature of COVID-19, our society, and our economy. In particular, we encourage you to consider how infectious diseases and societal responses to them disproportionately impact folks experiencing:

* Social isolation
* Housing insecurity
* Incarceration
* Insecure immigration status
* Lack of paid sick leave/ability to take time off from work
* Financial instability
* Lack of childcare in light of school closings

Several of these effects are discussed below, with others explored in the further reading sections.

## **Social isolation**

Social distancing asks us to stay physically separated from one another, which poses the risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness. \(Social distancing still allows for other forms of social connection, mostly through technology, that can help decrease social isolation and loneliness.\) This risk is particularly high for elderly individuals and those already isolated. While social distancing itself has not been studied, experts on social isolation and associated negative health outcomes have begun to [weigh in](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/we-are-social-species-how-will-social-distancing-affect-us) on potential impacts social distancing may have. If you’re interested, check out [this meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910600/) on the effect of social relationships on morbidity and mortality.

## **Impact on work**

Social distancing has become an important strategy for slowing viral spread and ‘flattening the curve.’ Nevertheless, it has had dramatic impacts for those unable to work from home, or businesses who rely on in-person interactions, such as brick and mortar stores, restaurants, museums, and theaters. Small business owners [in Boston](https://www.wgbh.org/news/local-news/2020/03/12/covid-19-hitting-boston-area-small-businesses) are grappling with closing their doors to help with social distancing efforts, even at the cost of losing income. [This article](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/13/21178879/coronavirus-covid-19-restaurant-workers-sick-leave-chipotle-mcdonalds) describes the struggle of food service workers whose work requires them to be public-facing, often without the option for paid sick leave. 

In response to lack of protections and continued low wages despite increasingly hazardous working conditions, workers from [Instacart, Amazon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/), and [Whole Foods](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmeka/whole-foods-employees-are-staging-a-nationwide-sick-out) have planned and begun to carry out strikes, starting March 30. Across the country, employees have begun to test positive for COVID-19, while operations have largely continued as normal. Workers have reported difficulty securing paid sick leave, as well as delayed notification of coworkers becoming sick. Workers [hope to secure](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/30/21200495/instacart-strike-coronavirus-covid-19-working-conditions-amazon-whole-foods-gig-economy) increased health precautions, hazard pay, and free coronavirus testing, among other protections. Additional smaller-scale strikes have been underway at restaurants, packaging facilities, and manufacturing plants across the country and around the world.

As this pandemic escalates, unemployment rates in the United States have soared in concert. During the week of 3/15-3/21, [more than 3 million Americans filed unemployment claims](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/business/economy/coronavirus-unemployment-claims.html); an additional [6.6 million Americans](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/02/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html#link-9b6ee1) filed for unemployment the following week. This number completely dwarfs the number of unemployed during any recession in decades \(image below\). Besides the obvious financial and economic implications of millions of Americans losing their jobs, the consequences of these Americans losing their employer-provider insurance during a pandemic could be dire. Notably, though other countries have put into place similarly restrictive social distancing policies, they have not triggered similar massive unemployment claims. Instead, many countries have enacted policies where employers pay a certain percentage of salary during this time and guarantee employment once the pandemic has passed \(discussed in this [New York Times opinion piece](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/opinion/coronavirus-economy-saez-zucman.html)\). How quickly and effectively a nation’s economy recovers from this pandemic may rely on creative strategies implemented now.

## **Financial instability and the economic implications of the pandemic**

On a larger scale, COVID-19 is already affecting the global marketplace, and will likely continue to evolve over the coming weeks. For anyone watching the nightly news, it’s hard to ignore the market tickers at the bottom of the screen as they drop precipitously. Stocks have had some of their largest single day declines since 1987, and continue their downward trajectory. While certainly not this audience’s area of expertise, it may prove beneficial to understand the economic implications of a pandemic as its impact will be felt universally. To understand how the economy has already been impacted, please see [this article](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-51706225) from the BBC.

The likely economic impact of this pandemic is two-fold. First, there will be a supply shock as supply chains are affected by factory closings, worker absences, and border closures, which will be exacerbated by collapse in consumer demand. On several measures, consumer confidence is already lower than it was during the financial crisis of 2008. Unfortunately, our fundamental governmental levers for fiscal and monetary policy at some level presume that there is no shortfall in economic labor. This presumption is misguided in the current situation. The supply and demand chain is being disrupted in a variety of ways, as highlighted by [this article](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-depression.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20200330&utm_term=4491715&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=4456219&orgid=305). Here we will highlight some of the more significant factors contributing to the supply and demand shock. 

First, there is certainly a decrease in economic labor. Consider the fact that one in four Americans are being ordered to stay home under the stay at home orders implemented in various states, and even more members of the global workforce are being asked to stay home under stricter international quarantine policies. This decrease in labor can only be exacerbated by poor working conditions, limited worker protection, and decreased compensation, prompting worker strikes as outlined above. If companies and factories are not already impacted by the loss of workers, they face constraints on their ability to produce a sufficient supply. Many production centers work at a stable basal rate and are rarely equipped to operate under conditions that result from a surge in demand such as that for medical masks. 

In order to accommodate an increase in demand for one good and a decrease in demand for another, some production centers are able to contribute to the dwindling supply by modifying their own efforts. However, this modification is more feasible if the demanded good is easier to produce. Consider distilleries modifying their production lines to produce hand sanitizer, a manufacturing adjustment that is much easier to accommodate than the demand for masks, which would require more specialized production. 

This issue highlights another shock being introduced to the supply-demand system of our economy. With social distancing orders in place, there has been a precipitous decline in demand for many goods, meaning that production must halt entirely and, at times, results in the wasting of goods. Decreases in travel and tourism, particularly from China, are revealing unique balances that exist within the supply-demand chain as a result of global interconnectedness \(for more details, see the [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/#resources)\). On the whole, the short timeline on which supply and demand chains were altered due to the pandemic drastically impacted the economy’s ability to compensate for rapidly depleted labor and supplies in accordance with shifting demands. 

Structural and political mismanagement of the situation have the ability to worsen an economic downturn. These and other economic principles, in addition to GDP trends during other pandemics in history, are outlined in [an article](https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy) from the Harvard Business Review. 

Some economists have called for [increased guidance](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/03/31/824103765/the-case-for-more-federal-action-to-combat-covid-19) from the federal government in directing industry to produce supplies, as well as a more unified consolidated response unifying the economic and public health responses. Through the end of March, many analyses had put these two realms in opposition to one another, implying that either public health or a robust economy must be sacrificed at the others’ expense. A recent [letter to the editor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-depression.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20200330&utm_term=4491715&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=4456219&orgid=305) challenges policy makers to think outside this dichotomy, and suggests that the current best option is aggressive testing and precautions that allow our economy and our world to return to normal more quickly.While the economic impact of the pandemic is certainly alarming, some economists have also called on us to question what ‘returning to normal’ prematurely may mean for the economy. A recent [Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/sarahhansen/2020/03/27/heres-how-much-it-could-cost-if-we-stop-social-distancing/#5608c4c06167) highlights the fact that, yes, the economy, primarily through supply-demand imbalances and financial constraints of medical care, has plummeted. However, if we prematurely ‘return to normal,’ the economy could take further dives. For example,Consider this: with an early end to social distancing, various models predict that there will be millions of additional COVID-related hospitalizations and deaths. 

Current economic models utilize the “value of a statistical life” to further understand the benefits of saving one life. At the moment, this value is $10 million per life. According to James Hammitt, the author of the Forbes article cited above, this means that, “if we could prevent a million deaths, at the usual way we value \[them\] of around $10 million each, that’s $10 trillion, which is half of GDP.” \(James Hammitt to Forbes in the above article\). These calculations docalculationsThis bolstering of the economy does not take into account for the decrease in hospitalizations and sick leave that also take their own toll on the economy. ISo instead of viewing social distancing as thean acute threat to the economy that it may be, several economists, including those at the [University of Chicago](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/insight/blog/key-economic-facts-about-covid-19/), implore the general public to view social distancing as a means to bolstering the future of the economy.

_Thought Questions:_

* What is the role of the federal government in public health and economic responses to COVID-19?
* How can public health and economic responses work synergistically?

## **Social stigma and racism**

As rates of COVID-19 infection have increased across the United States, so too have racist and xenophobic sentiments toward Chinese and Chinese-American people, or, more broadly, people who appear East Asian. This has escalated to include [verbal and physical attacks and avoidance of Asian American small businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html). While it has been difficult to quantify, various community organizations and media outlets have noted a sharp increase in tips and reports. Many have linked this behavior to politicians’ [repeated use](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html) of “the Chinese virus” or "Wuhan virus" rather than “COVID-19” or “coronavirus,” raising concerns about scapegoating. The WHO has cautioned against language that promotes social stigma or attaches locations to the illness. Further guidance from the WHO in preventing social stigma and the spread of inaccurate information can be found [here](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid19-stigma-guide.pdf). Guidance with respect to addressing these microaggressions can be found in [Module 4: Cultural Humility & Meeting People Where They Are](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-4-communicating-information-about-covid-19/cultural-humility).

## **What Is being done in response?**

President Donald Trump enacted the [Coronavirus Guidelines for America on](https://www.whitehouse.gov/briefings-statements/coronavirus-guidelines-america/) March 16, 2020, including measures such as avoiding gatherings of more than 10 people, working from home when possible, closing schools, and avoiding unnecessary travel, among others. On March 29, 2020, in light of recommendations from multiple public health advisors, President Trump extended these guidelines from April 12 to [April 30](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-guidelines.html).

Congress has begun to address the social and economic impacts caused by COVID-19 and its resulting guidelines with the Families First Coronavirus Response Act, which passed both chambers of Congress and was signed by the President on March 18. This bill includes the following \(read the full text [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/house-bill/6201/text)\):

* Expands paid sick leave
* Provides additional funding to WIC and other supplemental nutrition programs
* Expands requirements for SNAP
* Mandates that COVID-19 testing will be free
* Expands requirements around employers’ infectious disease control plans

Senate Republicans and Democrats also constructed the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and Economic Security Act \(CARES\), a [$2 trillion stimulus package](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/25/us/politics/whats-in-coronavirus-stimulus-bill.html). The [Senate unanimously voted in its favor](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/25/politics/stimulus-senate-action-coronavirus/index.html), followed by an overwhelming majority in the House, with one objection forcing Representatives from around the U.S. to cross state lines and gather in the House Chamber. [President Trump signed the bill on March 27](https://www.washingtonpost.com/us-policy/2020/03/27/congress-coronavirus-house-vote/), however, partisan disagreement remains regarding many implementation logistics. This package will include \(read the most recent text [here](https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/3548/text)\):

* Direct payments to taxpayers, with the IRS disbursing up to $1,200 per taxpayer based on 2018 and 2019 tax returns, with an additional $500 per child
* Extension of unemployment benefits
* Loans to small businesses
* Bailouts for larger businesses
* Increased funding and Medicare payments to hospitals

_Thought questions_:

* Is $1,200 the right amount to give to each American taxpayer during this time? What other considerations or stipulations would you make?
* $1,200 is approximately how much an American minimum-wage worker being paid $7.25/hour for 40 hours would make for 4 weeks of work. How does this change your thoughts on the above discussion? Does this change how you think about the American minimum wage?

[Additional considerations](https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20200312.363618/full/) and priorities put forth by experts from a variety of fields include targeting protections for vulnerable groups, bolstering public health infrastructure, and enabling rapid development of vaccines and treatments. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services have expanded access to [telemedicine](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet) \([see above](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/implication-for-the-healthcare-system-beyond-covid-19-patients#routine-and-chronic-care)\). Local action has taken place with respect to housing, with Massachusetts [suspending](https://www.mass.gov/housing-court-rules/housing-court-standing-order-2-20-temporary-modifications-to-court-operations) all non-emergent housing court proceedings \(including most evictions\) until April 21.

## **Understanding the medical supply shortage**

After the 2014-2016 Ebola outbreak in West Africa, the White House issued a [memorandum](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6823-national-security-counci-ebola/05bd797500ea55be0724/optimized/full.pdf) explaining that, when the U.S. government attempted to mobilize, “gaps in preparedness and capacity surfaced in every major agency tasked with health and security in the U.S. government.” The report asserted that “the current scale of response activities… is likely not sufficient,” and that future infectious disease threats, “especially those that are airborne and transmissible before symptoms appear” are “ among the most serious threats to our homeland and to international security.” An office was created within the National Security Council to manage potential pandemic responses, and an [“H9N2 simulation”](https://www.politico.com/news/2020/03/16/trump-inauguration-warning-scenario-pandemic-132797) of a global influenza pandemic was run in early 2017. 

Unfortunately, many of the White House staff present for that simulation were no longer in office at the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, and the office dedicated to managing the U.S. response to a global pandemic was dismantled in 2018. In a later global influenza pandemic simulation called [Crimson Contagion 2019](https://int.nyt.com/data/documenthelper/6824-2019-10-key-findings-and-after/05bd797500ea55be0724/optimized/full.pdf), it was noted that the “current medical countermeasure supply chain and production capacity \[could\] not meet the demands” of nations in the scenario, and that officials were unsure of how the Defense Production Act could be implemented. This latter simulation brought to light the [inability of the U.S](http://nytimes.com/2020/03/19/us/politics/trump-coronavirus-outbreak.html). to manufacture personal protective equipment \(PPE\), medication, and ventilators, among other medical supplies in the setting of a global pandemic. Adding to the potential for a medical supply shortage if a pandemic were to occur, after H1N1 in 2009, the national stockpile of face masks [was not fully replenished](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/face-masks-in-national-stockpile-have-not-been-substantially-replenished-since-2009/2020/03/10/57e57316-60c9-11ea-8baf-519cedb6ccd9_story.html), and, in early February, the [U.S. sent “masks, gowns, gauze, respirators, and other vital materials”](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/29/opinions/coronavirus-personal-protective-equipment-obeidallah/index.html) to China for support in its own COVID-19 crisis. On March 4, 2020, the Department of Health and Human Services \(HHS\) released a [statement](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/04/hhs-clarifies-us-has-about-1percent-of-face-masks-needed-for-full-blown-pandemic.html) that the U.S. had 1% of the respirator masks needed in the event of COVID-19 becoming a pandemic, with a Strategic National Stockpile containing only 12 million medical-grade N95 masks and 30 million surgical face masks. 

Two weeks later, on March 18, 2020, the White House invoked but did not activate the [Defense Production Act \(DPA\)](https://www.vox.com/2020/3/18/21185333/coronavirus-defense-production-act-trump).  The DPA gives the President the authority to order manufacturers to increase their production of needed supplies \(such as masks, respirators, and ventilators\) in times of emergency. Once the act has been invoked, industries are obligated to fill orders coming from the federal government before any others, and the federal government can distribute medical supplies according to need instead of ability to pay. Without activation of the DPA, [state governors have been forced to compete with one another and the federal government](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/26/gouged-prices-middlemen-medical-supply-chaos-why-governors-are-so-upset-with-trump/) to purchase medical supplies, which has led to increases in medical supply cost and counterfeit sales.

President Trump issued an [executive order](https://www.hhs.gov/about/news/2020/03/25/hhs-implements-president-trumps-hoarding-prevention-executive-order.html) under the DPA on March 25, 2020 “preventing hoarding of health and medical resources necessary to respond to COVID-19” by “business, personal, and home” interests, including but not limited to N95 and other filtering facepiece respirators, portable ventilators, medical gowns or apparel, and PPE. On March 27, 2020, the President [activated the DPA](https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2020/03/25/is-trump-using-defense-production-act/) to force General Motors to produce ventilators, however, no such action was taken for PPE. Given the current PPE shortage, many healthcare professionals have resorted to [wearing garbage bags and home-made cloth masks for protection](https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2020/3/27/21194402/coronavirus-masks-n95-respirators-personal-protective-equipment-ppe), and several hospitals in New York City and the tri-state area have either formally or informally implemented [do-not-resuscitate orders](https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2020/03/31/new-york-city-hospitals-coronavirus/) to prevent provider exposure to COVID-19 during cardiopulmonary resuscitation. 

For more information on how to optimize PPE use in our current shortage, please see [Module 5: Personal Protective Equipment](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-5-training-for-medical-student-specific-roles/personal-protective-equipment).  

_Thought questions:_

* What types of public health and health care delivery interventions introduced during this crisis have staying power, and why? \(e.g. telemedicine, expansion of sick leave\)
* The pandemic has been described as a global phenomenon that has exposed the “Achilles’ heel” of many social and structural shortcomings. What shortcomings have you identified during this pandemic and if given the chance, how would you propose we address them after the pandemic is over?
