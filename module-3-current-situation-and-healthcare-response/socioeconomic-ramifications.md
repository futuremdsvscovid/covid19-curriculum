# Socioeconomic Ramifications in the United States

Illness and health have an impact on our lives and communities, and vice versa. COVID-19 is no exception--the ways we gather and interact with one another directly enable transmission of this disease, and steps to mitigate disease spread have ripple effects in our lives. In particular, we encourage you to consider how infectious diseases and societal responses to them disproportionately impact folks experiencing:

* Social isolation
* Housing insecurity
* Incarceration
* Insecure immigration status
* Lack of paid sick leave/ability to take time off from work
* Financial instability
* Lack of childcare in light of school closings

Several of these effects are discussed below, with others explored in the further reading sections.  


## Social Isolation

Social distancing asks us to stay physically separated from one another, posing the risk of increasing social isolation and loneliness \(social distancing still allows for other forms of social connection, mostly through technology, that can help decrease social isolation and loneliness\). This risk is particularly high for elderly individuals and those already isolated. While social distancing’s relationship to isolation and mental health implications has not been studied, experts on social isolation and associated negative health outcomes have begun to [weigh in](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/we-are-social-species-how-will-social-distancing-affect-us) on potential impacts social distancing may have. See [this meta-analysis](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2910600/) on the effect of social relationships on morbidity and mortality for more information.   


## Social Stigma and Racism

As rates of COVID-19 infection have increased across the United States, so too have racist and xenophobic sentiments toward Chinese and Chinese-American people, or, more broadly, people who appear East Asian. This has escalated to  include [verbal and physical attacks and avoidance of Asian American small businesses](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html). While it has been difficult to quantify, various community organizations and media outlets have noted a sharp increase in tips and reports. Many have linked this behavior to politicians’ [repeated use](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html) of “the Chinese virus” or “Wuhan virus” rather than “COVID-19” or “coronavirus,” raising concerns about scapegoating. The WHO has cautioned against language that promotes social stigma or attaches locations to the illness. Further guidance from the WHO in preventing social stigma and the spread of inaccurate information can be found [here](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/covid19-stigma-guide.pdf).  


## Insecure Immigration Status

Restrictions on land and air travel to limit viral spread, while necessary from a public health standpoint, have placed significant stress on immigrants, recent migrants, asylum seekers, and those in immigration detention. These populations are at increased risk for COVID exposure and associated socioeconomic hardship as “immigrants on average have less access to safety-net benefits, are more likely to lack health insurance coverage, and have lower median incomes than the U.S. born” \([Chisti & Pierce, MPI](https://www.migrationpolicy.org/article/crisis-within-crisis-immigration-time-covid-19)\). Various policies enacted in response to the pandemic, including the CARES Act mentioned above, exclude immigrants and fail to recognize that “every person’s health and financial stability are critical” \([ACLU](https://www.aclu.org/news/immigrants-rights/covid-19-doesnt-discriminate-neither-should-congress-response/)\). While legislative policies have neglected to protect these populations, many of them find themselves labeled as “essential”, whether they are working within the hospital systems, in the service industry, or in the food industry. Certain considerations will need to be made about legal immigration status and visas that are essential to the farm industry -- as the [U.S. has halted H2A visas](https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/u-s-restricts-visas-farmworkers-raising-concerns-about-food-supply-n1164216) that allow migrant farmworkers to enter the country each growing season. See more [here](https://www.epi.org/publication/coronavirus-and-farmworkers-h-2a/) on farmworker visas. Additionally, there have been [several efforts](https://www.npr.org/sections/coronavirus-live-updates/2020/04/21/839470122/federal-judge-orders-ice-to-consider-releasing-detainees-at-high-risk-for-covid) to protect those in ICE detention centers, with several legal advocates and judges calling on the detention centers to release residents to mitigate the spread of COVID. These are some of the myriad issues facing this at risk population in the face of the pandemic, but certainly not a complete picture. Hopefully, in the weeks to come this population will also be included in the ongoing efforts to combat disparities during the pandemic.

## Accessing Resources: Food and Housing

Lack of income due to job loss, stay at home orders, and “panic buying” have made it difficult for many Americans to find and purchase needed food. Food insecurity has the potential to rise by over [10 million individuals](https://hungerandhealth.feedingamerica.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Brief_Covid-and-Food-Insecurity-3.30.pdf) in the coming months, similar to levels seen during the Great Recession. Record numbers of families are relying on [food banks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/08/business/economy/coronavirus-food-banks.html?searchResultPosition=2) and other emergency food resources at the same time that these organizations are seeing fewer donations from the hospitality industry. Food insecurity and social isolation are [compounded](https://www.chicagotribune.com/opinion/commentary/ct-opinion-coronavirus-food-insecurity-snap-meals-20200406-xal2ojigbjbh3afegihtowqwri-story.html) within communities at the highest risk for COVID-related complications, as food deserts overlap with areas of high unemployment and rates of comorbid conditions.

Similar to food insecurity, the risk for housing insecurity is increased with loss of income from unemployment. While [eviction bans](https://time.com/5820634/evictions-coronavirus/) have been implemented around the country, loopholes mean that many individuals still lose their housing. Living with many people in the same household makes it difficult for those who become ill to comply with self-isolation . Even social distancing for healthy individuals looks [drastically different](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/27/business/economy/coronavirus-inequality.html) between low and high income levels.

## Impact on Work: Small Businesses, Essential Workers, and Unemployment

Social distancing has become an important strategy for slowing viral spread and ‘flattening the curve.’ Nevertheless, it has had dramatic impacts for those unable to work from home, as well as businesses that rely on in-person interactions, such as brick and mortar stores, restaurants, museums, and theaters. [Early research](https://hbswk.hbs.edu/item/how-are-small-businesses-adjusting-to-covid-19-early-evidence-from-a-survey) has shown that nearly half of small businesses have temporarily closed, and large numbers of small business employees have been furloughed or permanently let go. Compounding the current crisis, financial fragility is the norm for these businesses, with many unable to sustain even one month of expenses without their typical cash flow. Many businesses are seeking support through the CARES act and [additional loan and grant programs](https://www.forbes.com/sites/advisor/2020/04/10/list-of-coronavirus-covid-19-small-business-loan-and-grant-programs/#4a92c597cc4b), though many of these are plagued with bureaucratic hoops. [This article](https://www.vox.com/the-goods/2020/3/13/21178879/coronavirus-covid-19-restaurant-workers-sick-leave-chipotle-mcdonalds) describes the struggle of food service workers whose work requires them to be public-facing, often without the option for paid sick leave. 

Essential workers, including grocery workers, food service workers, public transit drivers, and many more, are exposed to the public on a daily basis, often without the protection they need. In response to lack of protections and continued low wages despite increasingly hazardous working conditions, workers from [Instacart, Amazon](https://www.washingtonpost.com/technology/2020/03/30/worker-strike-instacart-amazon-whole-foods/), and [Whole Foods](https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/5dmeka/whole-foods-employees-are-staging-a-nationwide-sick-out) [have organized around](https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/3/30/21200495/instacart-strike-coronavirus-covid-19-working-conditions-amazon-whole-foods-gig-economy) increased health precautions, hazard pay, and free COVID-19 testing, among other protections. Additional smaller-scale strikes have occurred at restaurants, packaging facilities, and manufacturing plants around the world. As the pandemic progresses, evidence is emerging that these workers are [getting sick](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/04/06/supermarket-workers-deaths-coronavirus-/) and [dying](https://slate.com/news-and-politics/2020/04/essential-workers-deaths-underclass.html) at disproportionate rates. With lack of sick leave and low pay rates , these employees often feel forced to continue working to provide for their families, even if they feel unsafe or unwell.

As this pandemic escalates, unemployment rates in the United States have soared. Over the five weeks since March 15, over 26 million individuals have filed for unemployment, according to the [Bureau of Labor Statistics](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/23/business/stock-market-today-coronavirus.html). A record-high 6.9 million filed for the week ending on March 28 alone, nearly 10 times the [previous record](https://www.vox.com/2020/4/9/21213449/unemployment-initial-claims-us-april-4).  Estimates updated on April 16 put the U.S. unemployment rate [between 10 and 15 percent](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/03/upshot/coronavirus-jobless-rate-great-depression.html), with an increase of 0.5% per day. This number dwarfs the unemployment rate during any recession in decades. The increase in unemployment claims has [overwhelmed the system](https://time.com/5816775/coronavirus-unemployment-stimulus/), leading to hours-long waits on the phone, crashing websites, and ultimately, delays in accessing benefits that people need to pay their bills now. Notably, though other countries have put into place similarly restrictive social distancing policies, they have not triggered similar massive unemployment claims. Instead, [many countries have enacted policies](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/30/opinion/coronavirus-economy-saez-zucman.html) that require employers to pay a certain percentage of an employee’s salary during this time and guarantee employment once the pandemic has passed. How quickly and effectively a nation’s economy recovers from this pandemic may rely on creative strategies implemented now.

## Economic Implications of the Pandemic

The economic effects of the pandemic are many and will likely continue to become evident in months and years to come. It is likely we will enter a recession, and unlike some prior recessions, this one is abrupt and global. Some overarching themes to understand these effects include a decrease in labor, supply chain disruptions, and a decrease in demand for many consumer goods.

First, there is certainly a decrease in labor. This decrease in labor is exacerbated by poor working conditions, limited worker protection, and decreased compensation, prompting worker strikes as outlined above. Many production centers work at a stable basal rate and are not equipped to operate under conditions that result from a surge in demand, such as that for medical masks. In order to accommodate an increase in demand for one good and a decrease in demand for another, some production centers are able to contribute to the dwindling supply by modifying their efforts, however, this modification is more feasible if the demanded good is easier to produce. Consider distilleries modifying their production lines to produce hand sanitizer, a manufacturing adjustment that is much easier to accommodate than the demand for ventilators, which requires more specialized production. 

This issue highlights another shock introduced -- a precipitous decline in demand for many goods, meaning production must halt entirely and, at times, results in the wasting of goods. Decreases in travel and tourism, particularly from China, are revealing balances that exist within the supply-demand chain as a result of global interconnectedness \(for more details, see the [OECD report](https://www.oecd.org/economic-outlook/#resources)\). 

Structural and political mismanagement of the situation have the ability to worsen an economic downturn. These and other economic principles, in addition to GDP trends during other pandemics in history, are reviewed [here](https://hbr.org/2020/03/what-coronavirus-could-mean-for-the-global-economy). 

Some economists have called for [increased guidance](https://www.npr.org/sections/money/2020/03/31/824103765/the-case-for-more-federal-action-to-combat-covid-19) from the federal government in directing industry to produce supplies, as well as a more consolidated response unifying economic and public health responses. Many analyses initially put these two realms in opposition to one another, implying that either public health or a robust economy must be sacrificed at the others’ expense. However, [a panel of top economists](http://www.igmchicago.org/surveys/policy-for-the-covid-19-crisis/) overwhelmingly disagrees with this dichotomy, supporting public health measures as tools for economic recovery. A [letter to the editor](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-depression.html?utm_source=npr_newsletter&utm_medium=email&utm_content=20200330&utm_term=4491715&utm_campaign=money&utm_id=4456219&orgid=305) challenges policy makers to think outside of this dichotomy, suggesting that we pursue aggressive testing and precautions that allow our economy and world to return to normal more quickly.

### Thought Questions:

* What is the role of the federal government in public health and economic responses to COVID?
* How can public health and economic responses work synergistically?
* The pandemic has been described as a global phenomenon that has exposed the “Achilles’ heel” of many social and structural shortcomings. What shortcomings have you identified during this pandemic and, if given the chance, how would you propose we address them after the pandemic ends?
