# Testing Capacity and Eligibility

## Testing Capacity

SARS-CoV-2 testing is a rapidly evolving aspect of the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed in [Module 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo/edit#), the current test to detect SARS-CoV-2 is a RT-PCR test, designed to detect small amounts of the pathogen in a patient’s respiratory tract. The assay is described in further detail here: [How Coronavirus Test Kits Work \| WSJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM), [CDC Tests for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), [CDC Detailed Protocol](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-for-detection-instructions.pdf).

[Testing capacity](https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-update-march-15-2020/31630997#) in the United States initially lagged far behind other countries. Factors contributing to the low U.S. testing capacity included regulatory requirements by the FDA, some of which have now been lifted; [faulty tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html) initially provided by the CDC; and limitations in healthcare infrastructure such as not enough laboratory personnel, supplies, and/or testing facilities such as tents and drive-through centers. This had resulted in “rationing” of tests, with eligibility being based not just on viral pathophysiology and clinical judgment, but also on epidemiology and public safety. The limitations of testing in the United States prevented contact tracing and effective individual isolation, as has been done in [South Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free) \(discussed in[ Module 2](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EFBj_94umrCbgP3qsdJkjBzWci9uY32wBJL5h8Ap5YA/edit#heading=h.uz01r2lw689y)\).

Over the course of days, however, commercial lab tests and hospital-specific protocols were developed based on CDC protocol, rapidly underwent FDA Emergency Use Authorization, and are beginning to address the need for diagnostics in the United States. On March 13, [Roche](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-begins-shipping-400-000-coronavirus-test-kits-per-week-u-s) was the first US company to receive FDA emergency use authorization for its commercially-developed test kits; 400,000 of its test kits per week will be shipped nationwide. [Thermo Fisher](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-quickly-oks-its-second-commercial-covid-19-test-from-thermo-fisher) was the second to receive FDA emergency use authorization on March 16, and hopefully these commercial tests will alleviate growing need. Increased testing capacity has also reduced turnaround time of testing from the initial estimate of days, to just 24-48 hours, though this may again shift as more people are tested.

As of 3/18, Massachusetts can test approximately 400 patients per day through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health \(MA DPH\) Laboratory, though commercial laboratories in Massachusetts are ramping up their capabilities. As of 3/18, Massachusetts General Hospital and Brigham and Women’s Hospital, as two examples in the Boston area, are live with their in-house tests as well.

_Thought questions:_

Based on what you have learned from Modules 1 and 2, for whom would you recommend PCR testing in an ideal resource situation?

With limited testing resources, who should be tested?

## Testing Eligibility

On the following page is an algorithm simplifying testing eligibility for COVID-19, adapted from MA DPH [guidelines](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-pui-criteria/download), published on 3/13/20 \(note: this was five days before many commercially-designed testing kits would be available\). As resource availability changes, these criteria may also change. Nevertheless, note how several categories of test eligibility initially queried epidemiological risk factors, such as the individual’s risk of disease transmission to multiple others, rather than just the probability of an individual having the disease.

Per MA DPH guidelines, all persons under investigation for COVID-19 should self-isolate until test results return. The CDC has released new [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) for discontinuing home isolation for symptomatic patients who are unable to be tested as well \(72 hours of no fevers without the use of antipyretic medications, improvement in other symptoms, and 7 days since symptom onset\). If a patient is tested, the CDC recommends that patients can leave their home after meeting three criteria: they no longer have a fever, other symptoms \(e.g. cough, shortness of breath\) have improved, and they have received two consecutive negative tests 24 hours apart.

_Thought question:_ 

Do you agree with the testing guidelines of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health? \(This is an area of active controversy!\)

What high-risk groups might be missing from these categories?

While the MA DPH guidelines are being followed locally, other institution-specific testing guidelines approach eligibility from a purely clinical view, rather than an epidemiological one. Especially for _inpatients_ with severe disease, these guidelines may incorporate additional workup, including signs \(SpO2 &lt;93%\), and/or pertinent positive or negative laboratory findings \(lymphopenia, negative procalcitonin\) and imaging findings \(bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray or bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT\). Additional workup for _outpatients_ may be costly, however, and carry the potential for disease transmission to healthcare workers and other patients in that healthcare facility. The differences in these guidelines emphasize the “art” of medicine.

### _Thought questions:_

How would increased testing help or hinder the healthcare system response to COVID-19?

What factors would be important to consider in implementing a widespread testing protocol for asymptomatic individuals? How might you weigh test characteristics, clinical management strategies, risks of testing, and economic implications?

## Telephone Triage and Drive-Through Testing

Many strategies are being implemented to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from those awaiting testing to other patients in healthcare waiting rooms or healthcare workers themselves. Often, patients are screened remotely, via virtual visit or telephone, by the above guidelines. Exact triage protocol varies by institution. For those who are determined to require testing, some institutions are attempting to develop “[drive-through](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus-testing.html)” testing capabilities to further limit exposure. As of 3/18, drive-through testing for patients who meet certain criteria by telephone triage is available in Massachusetts at several sites including through [Atrius Health](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/17/drive-through-coronavirus-tests-boston) in Fenway, Peabody, and Braintree; through Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; through [Cambridge Health Alliance](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/remote-coronavirus-testing-facilities-begin-to-open-in-mass/2093138/) in Somerville; through Brigham and Women’s Hospital at multiple sites; and at multiple sites in Cape Cod and Worcester. **The list of available drive-through testing sites is growing daily, and institutions will notify their healthcare personnel and patients.** All healthcare workers must wear droplet precaution personal protective equipment when obtaining respiratory specimens, and N95 respirators and eyewear if there is a risk of aerosolization of droplets during specimen collection \(e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage\).

Finally, it is important to note that RT-PCR testing of respiratory samples is not perfect. One estimate of the sensitivity of this test is only around 70% \([Xia et al, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200642)\). Serological tests are also being developed to aid in diagnosis of COVID-19, though they are not considered the gold standard diagnostic. Chest CT may also help, though, again, this modality is not recommended for first line diagnosis.
