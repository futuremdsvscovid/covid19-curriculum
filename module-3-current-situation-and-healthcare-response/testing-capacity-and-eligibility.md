# Testing Capacity and Eligibility

## Testing Capacity

SARS-CoV-2 testing is a rapidly evolving aspect of the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed in [Module 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside), the current test to detect SARS-CoV-2 is a RT-PCR test, designed to detect small amounts of the pathogen in a patient’s respiratory tract. The assay is described in further detail here: [How Coronavirus Test Kits Work \| WSJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM), [CDC Tests for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), [CDC Detailed Protocol](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-for-detection-instructions.pdf).

[Testing capacity](https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-update-march-15-2020/31630997#) in the United States initially lagged far behind other countries. Factors contributing to the low U.S. testing capacity included regulatory requirements by the FDA, some of which have now been lifted; [faulty tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html) initially provided by the CDC; and limitations in healthcare infrastructure such as not enough laboratory personnel, supplies, and/or testing facilities such as tents and drive-through centers. This had resulted in “rationing” of tests, with eligibility being based not just on viral pathophysiology and clinical judgment, but also on epidemiology and public safety. The limitations of testing in the United States prevented contact tracing and effective individual isolation, as has been done in [South Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free) \(discussed in[ Module 2](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles)\).

Over the course of days, however, commercial lab tests and hospital-specific protocols were developed based on CDC protocol, rapidly underwent FDA Emergency Use Authorization, and began to address the need for diagnostics in the United States. On March 13, [Roche](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-begins-shipping-400-000-coronavirus-test-kits-per-week-u-s) was the first US company to receive FDA emergency use authorization for its commercially-developed test kits; 400,000 of its test kits per week will be shipped nationwide. [Thermo Fisher](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-quickly-oks-its-second-commercial-covid-19-test-from-thermo-fisher) was the second to receive FDA emergency use authorization on March 16. Estimates on turnaround time for tests vary between several hours to up to [4 days](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa), as testing capacity tries to keep pace with an ever increasing number of tests being run.

While as recently as 3/18, Massachusetts only had the ability to test 400 patients per day through the Massachusetts Department of Public Health Laboratory, commercial laboratories in Massachusetts have increased their capabilities, allowing a total of 13,749 Massachusetts residents to receive testing as of 3/24. The state aims to run 3,500 tests daily but has not yet met this goal.. As of 3/25, patients have been tested at [the following labs](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-cases-in-massachusetts-as-of-march-24-2020/download): MA State Public Health Laboratory, ARUP, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, BioReference Laboratories, CDC, Children’s Hospital Boston, LabCorp, Mayo Clinic, Partners Healthcare, Quest, Tufts, Viracor, and other labs, with the majority of testing through the state lab and Quest.

_Thought questions:_

Based on what you have learned from [Modules 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside) and [2](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles), for whom would you recommend PCR testing in an ideal resource situation?

With limited testing resources, who should be tested?

As we increase testing capacity, which individuals should be the first to be added to testing criteria?

## Testing Eligibility

On the following page is an algorithm simplifying testing eligibility for COVID-19, adapted from MA DPH [guidelines](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-pui-criteria/download), published on 3/13/20 \(note: this was five days before many commercially-designed testing kits would be available\). As resource availability changes, these criteria may also change. Additionally, as individual hospitals develop their own in-house tests, they are developing their own modified testing criteria based on their needs and resources; this information is communicated with providers daily. Nevertheless, note how several categories of test eligibility initially queried epidemiological risk factors, such as the individual’s risk of disease transmission to multiple others, rather than just the probability of an individual having the disease. 

Per MA DPH guidelines, all persons under investigation for COVID-19 should self-isolate until test results return. The CDC has released new [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) for discontinuing home isolation for symptomatic patients who are unable to be tested as well, which include 72 hours of no fevers without the use of antipyretic medications, improvement in other symptoms \(e.g. cough, shortness of breath\), and 7 days since symptom onset\). If a patient will be tested, the CDC recommends that patients leave their home only after meeting three similar criteria: no fever, improvement in other symptoms, and two consecutive negative PCR tests 24 hours apart.

_Thought question:_ 

Do you agree with the testing guidelines of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health? \(This is an area of active controversy!\)

What high-risk groups might be missing from these categories?

While the MA DPH guidelines are being followed locally, other institution-specific testing guidelines approach eligibility from a purely clinical view, rather than an epidemiological one. Especially for _inpatients_ with severe disease, these guidelines may incorporate additional workup, including signs \(SpO2 &lt;93%\), and/or pertinent positive or negative laboratory findings \(lymphopenia, negative procalcitonin\) and imaging findings \(bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray or bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT\). Additional workup for _outpatients_ may be costly, however, and carry the potential for disease transmission to healthcare workers and other patients in that healthcare facility. The differences in these guidelines emphasize the “art” of medicine.

### _Thought questions:_

How would increased testing help or hinder the healthcare system response to COVID-19?

What factors would be important to consider in implementing a widespread testing protocol for asymptomatic individuals? How might you weigh test characteristics, clinical management strategies, risks of testing, and economic implications?

## Telephone Triage and Drive-Through Testing

Many strategies are being implemented to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from those awaiting testing to other patients in healthcare waiting rooms or healthcare workers themselves. Often, patients are screened remotely, using the above guidelines, via virtual visit or telephone. Exact triage protocol varies by institution. For those who are determined to require testing, some institutions are developing “[drive-through](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus-testing.html)” testing capabilities to further limit exposure. As of 3/18, drive-through testing for patients who meet certain criteria by telephone triage is available in Massachusetts at several sites including [Atrius Health](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/17/drive-through-coronavirus-tests-boston) in Fenway, Peabody, and Braintree; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; [Cambridge Health Alliance](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/remote-coronavirus-testing-facilities-begin-to-open-in-mass/2093138/) in Somerville; Brigham and Women’s Hospital at multiple sites; and multiple sites in Cape Cod and Worcester. As of 3/25, more drive through testing centers have been added including [Southcoast Health](https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20200323/southcoast-health-opens-first-drive-through-covid-19-testing-site-in-region), in [Waltham,](https://whdh.com/news/waltham-opens-drive-thru-coronavirus-testing-site/) at AFC Urgent Care and [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-cvs-opens-its-first-drive-up-testing-site-in-massachusetts.html) in Shrewsbury for first responders. **The list of available drive-through testing sites is growing daily, and institutions will notify their healthcare personnel and patients.** All healthcare workers must wear droplet precaution personal protective equipment when obtaining respiratory specimens and N95 respirators and eyewear if there is a risk of aerosolization of droplets during specimen collection \(e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage\).

Finally, it is important to note that RT-PCR testing of respiratory samples is imperfect. One estimate of this test’s sensitivity is around 70% \([Xia et al, 2020](https://pubs.rsna.org/doi/full/10.1148/radiol.2020200642)\). Serological tests are also being developed to aid in diagnosis and detection of prior infection with COVID-19, though they are not considered to be the gold standard. [CRISPR-based testing](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00827-6), a more rapid technique that could also reduce turnaround time, is being developed at the University of Washington School of Medicine, the Broad Institute, and Mammoth Biosciences. Chest CT may aid in diagnosis, though this modality is not recommended as the first line.
