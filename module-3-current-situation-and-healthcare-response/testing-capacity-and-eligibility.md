# Testing Capacity and Eligibility

## Testing capacity

SARS-CoV-2 testing is a rapidly evolving aspect of the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed in [Module 1](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/clinical-presentation-of-covid-19#diagnostics), the current test to detect SARS-CoV-2 is a RT-PCR test, designed to detect small amounts of the pathogen in a patient’s respiratory tract. The assay is described in further detail here: [How Coronavirus Test Kits Work \| WSJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM), [CDC Tests for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), [CDC Detailed Protocol](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-for-detection-instructions.pdf).

[Testing capacity](https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-update-march-15-2020/31630997#) in the United States initially lagged behind that of other countries due to regulatory requirements by the FDA [faulty tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html) provided by the CDC, and limitations in healthcare infrastructure such as not enough laboratory personnel, supplies, and/or testing facilities such as tents and drive-through centers. These policies resulted in “rationing” of tests, with eligibility based not only on viral pathophysiology and clinical judgment, but also on epidemiology and public safety. The limitations of testing in the U.S. prevented contact tracing and effective individual isolation, as has been done in [South Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free) \(discussed in [Module 2](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-2-epidemiology-principles/case-study-south-korea-2020)\).

Commercial lab tests and hospital-specific protocols were quickly developed based on CDC protocol, underwent FDA Emergency Use Authorization \(EUA\), and began to address the need for diagnostics in the United States. On March 13, [Roche](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-begins-shipping-400-000-coronavirus-test-kits-per-week-u-s) was the first U.S. company to receive FDA EUA for its commercially-developed test kits, with 400,000 of its test kits shipped nationwide every week, and [Thermo Fisher](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-quickly-oks-its-second-commercial-covid-19-test-from-thermo-fisher) was the second on March 16. Estimates on turnaround time for tests vary between several hours to up to [five days](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa), as testing capacity tries to keep pace with an ever increasing number of tests being run. 

Given the limitations of the RT-PCR tests, there has been substantial interest in creating point-of-care tests. On March 21, Danaher’s molecular diagnostics branch, Cepheid, [received FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/136314/download) EUA to produce a point-of-care diagnostic test that could yield results within 45 minutes, with a plan to [distribute March 30](https://www.barrons.com/articles/danaher-stock-subsidiary-fda-covid-19-test-51584969017?mod=article_inline). Abbott, an American medical devices and healthcare company, was [granted FDA](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rapid-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-provide-results-minutes/story?id=69875037) EUA on March 27 for [ID NOW COVID-19](https://www.alere.com/en/home/product-details/id-now-covid-19.html), a point-of-care diagnostic test that can return positive results in five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes, marking its second EUA for COVID-19 diagnostic testing since the outbreak. Abbott produces 50,000 units per day, and, [as of April 3](https://www.abbott.com/corpnewsroom/product-and-innovation/an-update-on-abbotts-work-on-COVID-19-testing.html), had distributed over 190,000 tests to 21 states. In early April, a testing center using Abbott’s point-of-care test opened in [Lowell, MA](https://www.masslive.com/coronavirus/2020/04/massachusetts-introduces-new-rapid-covid-19-testing-site-offering-up-to-1000-free-tests-daily.html) and is set up to offer 1,000 rapid, free COVID-19 tests daily. There has also been controversy regarding at-home testing. On March 20, the FDA released a [statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-alerts-consumers-about-unauthorized-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits) reporting that there is currently no approved at home testing, and that tests marketed as such are “fraudulent.” Startups including but not limited to [Everlywell, Nurx, and Carbon Health](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/03/31/home-coronavirus-test-fda-shut-them-down-but-they-solution/5080703002/) have been forced to withdraw their at home tests from the market. Not all patients who received these tests have received refunded or had approved COVID-19 testing. 

The first FDA EUA for a serology test was granted to [Cellex on April 1](https://www.fda.gov/media/136622/download). According to the Letter of Authorization, this qualitative test will detect SARS-CoV-2 IgM and IgG antibodies in a patient’s blood. These antibodies are, “generally detectable… several days after initial infection, although levels over the course of infection are not well-characterized.” Additional diagnostic tests in development include [CRISPR and antigen-detection](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-020-00010-2); for more information please see [Module 1: Diagnostics](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/clinical-presentation-of-covid-19#diagnostics). For a complete list of FDA EUAs, please refer to the [COVID-19 Emergency Use Authorizations for Medical Devices](https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/emergency-situations-medical-devices/emergency-use-authorizations).

Commercial laboratories in Massachusetts have increased their capabilities, allowing almost over 76[,000 Massachusetts residents](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring) to receive testing as of 4/7. The[ Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/broad-institute%E2%80%99s-clia-certified-testing-center-begins-processing-covid-19-patient-samples) has scaled its Clinical Research Sequencing Platform to test 2,000 samples per day in an effort to reach the state's goal of 3,500 tests daily. As of 4/7 , patients have been tested at over [20 public and private labs](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring), with the majority of testing through Quest.

_Thought questions:_

* Based on what you have learned from [Modules 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside) and [2](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles), for whom would you recommend PCR testing in an ideal resource situation?
* With limited testing resources, who should be tested?
* As we increase testing capacity, which individuals should be the first to be added to testing criteria?

## Testing eligibility

On the following page is an algorithm simplifying testing eligibility for COVID-19, adapted from MA DPH [guidelines](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-pui-criteria/download), updated on 4/2/20. Compared to the guidelines previously published on 3/13/20, the updated DPH guidelines: no longer require testing for other respiratory viruses prior to testing for COVID-19; distinguish between groups of patients who can be tested at the state lab and who should be tested at commercial labs; redefine close contact; expand symptoms rendering an individual eligible for testing; and increase consideration of clinical data such as imaging in determining who to test. As resource availability changes, these criteria will continue to change. Additionally, as individual hospitals develop in-house tests, they are developing their own modified testing criteria based on their needs and resources; this information is communicated with providers daily. Nevertheless, note that several categories of test eligibility continue to  query epidemiological risk factors, such as the individual’s risk of disease transmission to others, rather than the probability of an individual having COVID-19. 

Per MA DPH guidelines, all persons under investigation for COVID-19 should self-isolate until test results return. The CDC has also released new [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) for discontinuing home isolation for symptomatic patients who are unable to be tested, which include 72 hours of no fevers without the use of antipyretic medications, improvement in other symptoms \(e.g. cough, shortness of breath\), and seven days since symptom onset.

_Thought questions:_ 

* Do you agree with the testing guidelines of the [Massachusetts Department of Public Health](https://images.magnetmail.net/images/clients/MMS_/attach/MDPHTESTINGCRITERIA.pdf)?
* What high-risk groups might be missing from these categories?

While the MA DPH guidelines are being followed locally, other institution-specific testing guidelines approach eligibility from a purely clinical view, rather than an epidemiological one. Especially for inpatients with severe disease, these guidelines may incorporate additional workup, including signs \(SpO2 &lt;93%\), pertinent positive or negative laboratory findings \(lymphopenia, negative procalcitonin\), and imaging findings \(e.g. bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray or bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT\). Additional workup for outpatients may be costly, however, and carry the potential for disease transmission to healthcare workers and other patients in that healthcare facility. 

_Thought questions:_

* How would increased testing help or hinder the healthcare system response to COVID-19?
* What factors would be important to consider in implementing a widespread testing protocol for asymptomatic individuals? How might you weigh test characteristics, clinical management strategies, risks of testing, and economic implications?

## Telephone triage and drive-through testing

Many strategies are being implemented to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from those awaiting testing to other patients in healthcare waiting rooms or healthcare workers themselves. Often, patients are screened remotely, using the above guidelines, via virtual visit or telephone. Exact triage protocol varies by institution. For those who are determined to require testing, many institutions have developed  “[drive-through](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus-testing.html)” testing capabilities to limit exposure. The list of available drive-through testing sites is growing daily, and institutions will notify their healthcare personnel and patients. All healthcare workers must wear droplet precaution personal protective equipment \(PPE\) when obtaining respiratory specimens and N95 respirators and eyewear if there is a risk of aerosolization of droplets during specimen collection \(e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage, endoscopy\). At Partners Healthcare, N95 respirators are recommended for all nasopharyngeal swabbing.
