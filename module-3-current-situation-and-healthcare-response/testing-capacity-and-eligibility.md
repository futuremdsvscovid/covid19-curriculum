# Testing Capacity and Eligibility

## Testing Capacity

SARS-CoV-2 testing is a rapidly evolving aspect of the healthcare response to the COVID-19 pandemic. As discussed in [Module 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside), the current test to detect SARS-CoV-2 is a RT-PCR test, designed to detect small amounts of the pathogen in a patient’s respiratory tract. The assay is described in further detail here: [How Coronavirus Test Kits Work \| WSJ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tgyzdgf66eM), [CDC Tests for COVID-19](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html), [CDC Detailed Protocol](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/downloads/rt-pcr-panel-for-detection-instructions.pdf).

[Testing capacity](https://www.wcvb.com/article/massachusetts-coronavirus-covid-19-testing-update-march-15-2020/31630997#) in the U.S. initially lagged far behind that of other countries. Factors contributing to the low U.S. testing capacity included regulatory requirements by the FDA, some of which have now been lifted; [faulty tests](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/about/testing.html) initially provided by the CDC; and limitations in healthcare infrastructure including insufficient laboratory personnel, supplies, and/or testing facilities such as tents and drive-through centers. This resulted in “rationing” of tests, with eligibility based not only on viral pathophysiology and clinical judgment, but also on epidemiology and public safety. The limitations of testing in the U.S. prevented contact tracing and effective individual isolation, as has been done in [South Korea](https://www.npr.org/sections/goatsandsoda/2020/03/13/815441078/south-koreas-drive-through-testing-for-coronavirus-is-fast-and-free) \(discussed in [Module 2](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-2-epidemiology-principles/case-study-south-korea-2020)\).

Over the course of days, however, commercial lab tests and hospital-specific protocols were developed based on CDC protocol, rapidly underwent FDA Emergency Use Authorization \(EUA\), and began to address the need for diagnostics in the United States. On March 13, [Roche](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/roche-begins-shipping-400-000-coronavirus-test-kits-per-week-u-s) was the first U.S. company to receive FDA emergency use authorization for its commercially-developed test kits, with 400,000 of its test kits shipped nationwide every week. [Thermo Fisher](https://www.fiercebiotech.com/medtech/fda-quickly-oks-its-second-commercial-covid-19-test-from-thermo-fisher) was the second to receive FDA EUA on March 16. Estimates on turnaround time for tests vary between several hours to up to [five days](https://www.labcorp.com/tests/139900/2019-novel-coronavirus-covid-19-naa), as testing capacity tries to keep pace with an ever increasing number of tests being run. 

More recently, on March 21, Danaher’s molecular diagnostics branch, Cepheid, [received FDA](https://www.fda.gov/media/136314/download) EUA to produce a point-of-care diagnostic test that could yield results within 45 minutes, with a plan to [distribute March 30](https://www.barrons.com/articles/danaher-stock-subsidiary-fda-covid-19-test-51584969017?mod=article_inline). On March 27, Abbott, an American medical devices and healthcare company, was [granted FDA](https://abcnews.go.com/Health/rapid-coronavirus-diagnostic-test-provide-results-minutes/story?id=69875037) EUA for [ID NOW COVID-19](https://www.alere.com/en/home/product-details/id-now-covid-19.html), a point-of-care diagnostic test that can return positive results in five minutes and negative results within 13 minutes, marking its second EUA for COVID-19 diagnostic testing since the outbreak began. Abbott hopes to increase production, with a goal of 50,000 units per day to distribute over one million tests per month, with distribution beginning April 1.

There has also been controversy regarding at-home testing. On March 20, the FDA released a [statement](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/coronavirus-covid-19-update-fda-alerts-consumers-about-unauthorized-fraudulent-covid-19-test-kits) reporting that there is currently no approved at-home testing, and that tests marketed as such are “fraudulent.” Startups including but not limited to [Everlywell, Nurx, and Carbon Health](https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/investigations/2020/03/31/home-coronavirus-test-fda-shut-them-down-but-they-solution/5080703002/) have been forced to withdraw their at-home tests from the market. Not all patients who received these tests have received refunds or had approved COVID-19 testing. 

Commercial laboratories in Massachusetts have increased their capabilities, allowing almost [52,000 Massachusetts residents](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring) to receive testing as of April 1. The state aims to run 3,500 tests daily but has not yet met this goal. The[ Broad Institute](https://www.broadinstitute.org/news/broad-institute%E2%80%99s-clia-certified-testing-center-begins-processing-covid-19-patient-samples) has scaled its Clinical Research Sequencing Platform to test 2,000 samples per day in an effort to reach the state's goal. As of March 30, patients have been tested at [the following labs](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring): MA State Public Health Laboratory, ARUP, Baystate, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, Bedford Research Foundation, BioReference Laboratories, Boston Medical Center, BROAD Institute CRSP, CDC, Children’s Hospital Boston, Genesys Diagnostics, LabCorp, Mayo Clinic, Partners Healthcare, Quest, Tufts, UMASS Memorial, Viracor, and other labs, with the majority of testing through the state lab and Quest.

_Thought questions:_

* Based on what you have learned from [Modules 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside) and [2](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-2-epidemiology-principles), for whom would you recommend PCR testing in an ideal resource situation?
* With limited testing resources, who should be tested?
* As we increase testing capacity, which individuals should be the first to be added to testing criteria?

## Testing Eligibility

Below is an algorithm simplifying testing eligibility for COVID-19, adapted from MA DPH [guidelines](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-19-pui-criteria/download), published on 3/13/20 \(note: this was five days before many commercially-designed testing kits would be available\). As resource availability changes, these criteria may also change. Additionally, as individual hospitals develop their own in-house tests, they are developing their own modified testing criteria based on their needs and resources; this information is communicated with providers daily. Nevertheless, note how several categories of test eligibility initially queried epidemiological risk factors, such as the individual’s risk of disease transmission to multiple others, rather than just the probability of an individual having the disease. 

Per MA DPH guidelines, all persons under investigation for COVID-19 should self-isolate until test results return. The CDC has also released new [guidelines](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/if-you-are-sick/care-for-someone.html) for discontinuing home isolation for symptomatic patients who are unable to be tested, which include 72 hours of no fevers without the use of antipyretic medications, improvement in other symptoms \(e.g. cough, shortness of breath\), and seven days since symptom onset.

_Thought questions:_ 

* Do you agree with the testing guidelines of the Massachusetts Department of Public Health? \(This is an area of active controversy!\)
* What high-risk groups might be missing from these categories?

While the MA DPH guidelines are being followed locally, other institution-specific testing guidelines approach eligibility from a purely clinical view, rather than an epidemiological one. Especially for _inpatients_ with severe disease, these guidelines may incorporate additional workup, including signs \(SpO2 &lt;93%\) and/or pertinent positive or negative laboratory findings \(lymphopenia, negative procalcitonin\) and imaging findings \(bilateral pneumonia on chest X-ray or bilateral ground-glass opacities on CT\). Additional workup for _outpatients_ may be costly, however, and carry the potential for disease transmission to healthcare workers and other patients in that healthcare facility. The differences in these guidelines emphasize the “art” of medicine.

_Thought questions:_

* How would increased testing help or hinder the healthcare system response to COVID-19?
* What factors would be important to consider in implementing a widespread testing protocol for asymptomatic individuals? How might you weigh test characteristics, clinical management strategies, risks of testing, and economic implications?

## Telephone Triage and Drive-Through Testing

Many strategies are being implemented to limit transmission of SARS-CoV-2 from those awaiting testing to other patients in healthcare waiting rooms or healthcare workers themselves. Often, patients are screened remotely, using the above guidelines, via virtual visit or telephone. Exact triage protocol varies by institution. For those who are determined to require testing, some institutions are developing “[drive-through](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/nyregion/new-rochelle-coronavirus-testing.html)” testing capabilities to limit exposure. As of March 18, drive-through testing for patients who meet certain criteria by telephone triage is available in Massachusetts at several sites including [Atrius Health](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/03/17/drive-through-coronavirus-tests-boston) in Fenway, Peabody, and Braintree; Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center; [Cambridge Health Alliance](https://www.nbcboston.com/news/local/remote-coronavirus-testing-facilities-begin-to-open-in-mass/2093138/) in Somerville; Brigham and Women’s Hospital at multiple sites; and multiple sites in Cape Cod and Worcester. As of March 25, more drive through testing centers had been added, including [Southcoast Health](https://www.southcoasttoday.com/news/20200323/southcoast-health-opens-first-drive-through-covid-19-testing-site-in-region), in [Waltham,](https://whdh.com/news/waltham-opens-drive-thru-coronavirus-testing-site/) at AFC Urgent Care and [CVS](https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/19/coronavirus-cvs-opens-its-first-drive-up-testing-site-in-massachusetts.html) in Shrewsbury for first responders. **The list of available drive-through testing sites is growing daily, and institutions will notify their healthcare personnel and patients.** All healthcare workers must wear droplet precaution personal protective equipment when obtaining respiratory specimens and N95 respirators and eyewear if there is a risk of aerosolization of droplets during specimen collection \(e.g. bronchoalveolar lavage\).
