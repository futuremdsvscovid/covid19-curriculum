# Ongoing Clinical Trials

## Treatment

### Current status of antiviral treatment for COVID-19

## There is currently no controlled clinical data supporting the efficacy of any agent for the treatment of COVID-19. Therefore, current treatment recommendations by the WHO and the CDC comprise optimal supportive care only. Both organizations state that investigational agents should only be administered in the context of ethically-approved clinical trials or under the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions \(MEURI\) framework \(known as “compassionate use”\).

## [Module 1: Investigational Therapeutics](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo/edit#) provides background information and prior data on some of the most prominent antiviral agents currently being investigated for repurposing including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab.

## Here, we will outline recent reports and ongoing trials. A registry of clinical trials ongoing globally can be found on the [WHO International Clinical Trials Platform](http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/AdvSearch.aspx?SearchTermStat=117&ReturnUrl=~%2fListBy.aspx%3fTypeListing%3d0).

### Recent data supporting repurposed drug candidates for COVID-19

1. Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine

   _Recent Findings:_ 

2. February 2020: Gao et al. report that in a series of “more than 100 patients” in 10 hospitals across China “chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course” \([Gao et al., BioScience Trends 2020](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/14/1/14_2020.01047/_article)\). However, no clinical data has been provided, nor information on whether the study protocols were similar across the 10 hospitals.
3. March 2020: Yao et al. determine that SARS-CoV-2 is inhibited by both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine in vitro, with hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine \([Yao et al., Clin Inf Dis 2020](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa237/5801998)\).

   _Ongoing Clinical Trials:_ [&gt; 20 ongoing clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120303907) in China as of March 10 2020. [A post-exposure prophylaxis trial of hydroxychloroquine](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04308668) is also underway at the University of Minnesota.

```text
_Implications: _Hydroxychloroquine is a widely available drug (chloroquine is currently in limited supply). If proven clinically efficacious, their implementation would be relatively easy. 


_Future Questions: _Interim trial results of ongoing trials in China will provide important information as to efficacy. 
```

1. Remdesivir

   _Recent Findings:_

* February 2020: Wang et al. demonstrated that remdesivir possesses antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro \([Wang et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0)\). 
* March 2020: Holshue et al. describe a case report of the ‘compassionate use’ of remdesivir in one of the first patients in the United States, who had clinical improvement after critical illness \([Holsue et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191)\).

  _Ongoing Clinical Trials:_ [Multiple randomized trials of remdesivir](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid+19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) expect results by April or May 2020 \(recruiting in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States\). A large multicenter [NIH adaptive randomized controlled trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705?cond=adaptive+trial+COVID-19&draw=2&rank=1) is also investigating remdesivir.

```text
_Implications: _Remdesivir is a prominent candidate due to its high efficacy against all coronaviruses (it was considered the most promising in the [WHO’s R&D Blueprint Report](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330680/WHO-HEO-RDBlueprint%28nCoV%29-2020.1-eng.pdf?ua=1)) and the robust clinical safety exhibited in the Ebola virus trials. 


_Future Questions: _
```

1. Trials underway are investigating optimal length of infusion with a loading dose followed by 5 or 10 days. 
2. Is remdesivir most efficacious for mild, moderate, or severe disease? Trials underway are recruiting patients based on disease severity. 
3. Lopinavir/Ritonavir 

_Recent Findings:_ 

* March 2020: a case series in Singapore with 3 out of 5 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibiting improvements in fever and need for supplemental oxygen \([Young et al., JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762688)\). 
* March 2020: in a randomized controlled open label trial in 199 patients in Wuhan, China with enrollment from January 18 - February 3, there was no observed benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir over standard of care in terms of viral load, time to clinical improvement, or mortality \([Cao et al., NEJM 2020\)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282?fbclid=IwAR1Ikh2t3S1hThz7d8FZQqHY0wdXYlKZWe96w5UZuebbdWPZ__6lSoGy7K8).

  _Ongoing Clinical Trials:_ [Multiple trials are ongoing](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Coronavirus&term=lopinavir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=) involving lopinavir/ritonavir in comparison to and/or in combination with arbidol, ribavirin, IFN-beta, umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine, and additional protease inhibitors in China and Hong Kong.

```text
_Future Questions: _Whether these drugs alone or in combination have an effect on COVID-19 remains to be determined and is currently being investigated with larger sample sizes in clinical trials.
```

1. Tocilizumab

   _Recent Findings:_

* March 2020: Xu et al. described that in 15 out of 20 patients, treatment showed rapid resolution of symptoms, prompting China to approve the use of tocilizumab to treat patients with severe or critical disease \([Xu et al., ChinXiv 2020](http://www.chinaxiv.org/abs/202003.00026)\).

  \_Ongoing Clinical Trials: \_The WHO registry currently lists three studies \([one RCT](http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=49409)\) taking place in China, using tocilizumab as the primary intervention for the treatment of COVID-19. A randomized study on a related IL-6 receptor monoclonal antibody [sarilumab](https://www.the-rheumatologist.org/article/sanofi-regeneron-begin-testing-arthritis-drug-as-coronavirus-treatment/) will also begin in the United States.

```text
_Future questions: _High levels of IL-6 appear to correlate with disease severity <span style="text-decoration:underline;"><span style="text-decoration:underline;">([Liu et al., bioRxiv preprint, 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769v2))</span>. More studies need to be conducted to explore this relationship.

### Antibody treatments

These treatments are based on the idea that immunity can be transferred from one person to another by providing an antibody developed in someone \(or an animal\) previously exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 to a previously unexposed \(and thus unprotected immunologically\) to the virus. Different approaches are currently being used \([A detailed guide to the coronavirus drugs and vaccines in development](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-drugs-and-vaccines-in-development/)\):

* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: Using antibody-generating mice exposed to a harmless analogue of SARS-CoV-2, they aim to find a potent antibody that provides immunity in these mice to SARS-CoV-2. The hope is that these antibodies can also be given to humans to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During the Ebola outbreak in 2015, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals used a similar approach to develop a treatment for Ebola that significantly improved[ the survival rate](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1910993). 
* Vir Biotechnology: By isolating antibodies from patients who survived SARS \(which is a coronavirus related to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus\), they hope to determine whether these antibodies against SARS provide some benefit against this new related SARS-CoV-2 virus.

## Vaccines

For background on vaccines and their development, please see the section “[Vaccine Development](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo/edit#heading=h.q4zelof2m8jm)” in Module 1.

Many pharmaceutical companies and governments are currently in the process of developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and strategies with all of the above vaccine types are being utilized \([Pang et al., JCM 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/3/623/htm)\).

In general, potential mRNA and DNA vaccines have been developed more quickly because they only require knowing the [genetic sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/#nucleotide-sequences) of SARS-CoV-2 \(which was identified and quickly uploaded by Chinese researchers in January\), whereas whole pathogen vaccines require growing the virus and subunit vaccines require production of the proteins in a laboratory. Specific promising vaccines being developed include \([A detailed guide to the coronavirus drugs and vaccines in development](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-drugs-and-vaccines-in-development/)\):

* Moderna Therapeutics: mRNA vaccine
  * Moderna Therapeutics has developed a potential mRNA vaccine \(mRNA-1273\) for SARS-CoV-2. The use of this vaccine entered a Phase 1 study on March 16, 2020 conducted by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The goals of this study are to determine the safety & immunogenicity of the supposed vaccine and not the ability to prevent COVID-19 infection. The study involves 45 healthy adults aged 18-55 who each receive two injections of mRNA-1273 28 days apart. The group is also split up into 3 different series of dosages being tested. Moderna is the first company attempting to use mRNA as a basis for vaccine development. While they have several other vaccines using this technology in development \(H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3 and CMV\), there are no vaccines currently on the market that utilize this strategy for prophylactic vaccine treatment.
* CureVac: mRNA vaccine
  * Preclinical
* Inovio Pharmaceuticals: DNA vaccine
  * Preclinical
* Johnson and Johnson: Killed/inactivated whole pathogen vaccine
  * Preclinical
* Sanofi: Chimeric whole pathogen vaccine
  * Preclinical
