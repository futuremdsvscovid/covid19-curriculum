# Ongoing Clinical Trials

## Treatment

### Current status of antiviral treatment for COVID-19

**There is currently no controlled clinical data supporting the efficacy of any agent for the treatment of COVID-19.** Therefore, current treatment recommendations by the WHO and the CDC comprise optimal supportive care only. Both organizations state that investigational agents should only be administered in the context of ethically-approved clinical trials or under the Monitored Emergency Use of Unregistered Interventions \(MEURI\) framework \(known as “compassionate use”\).

[Module 1: Investigational Therapeutics](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/investigational-therapeutics-and-vaccine-development) provides background information and prior data on some of the most prominent antiviral agents currently being investigated for repurposing including chloroquine, hydroxychloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, and tocilizumab.

Here, we will outline recent reports and ongoing trials. A registry of clinical trials ongoing globally can be found on the [WHO International Clinical Trials Platform](http://apps.who.int/trialsearch/AdvSearch.aspx?SearchTermStat=117&ReturnUrl=~%2fListBy.aspx%3fTypeListing%3d0).

### Recent data supporting repurposed drug candidates for COVID-19

#### **Chloroquine and Hydroxychloroquine**

 Widely used anti-malarial + anti-inflammatory drugs 

_Recent Findings_: 

* February 2020: Gao et al. report that in a series of “more than 100 patients” in 10 hospitals across China, “chloroquine phosphate is superior to the control treatment in inhibiting the exacerbation of pneumonia, improving lung imaging findings, promoting a virus-negative conversion, and shortening the disease course” \([Gao et al., BioScience Trends 2020](https://www.jstage.jst.go.jp/article/bst/14/1/14_2020.01047/_article)\). However, no clinical data has been provided, nor information on whether the study protocols were similar across the 10 hospitals.  
* March 2020: Yao et al. determine that both chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine inhibit SARS-CoV-2 in vitro, with hydroxychloroquine more potent than chloroquine \([Yao et al., Clin Inf Dis 2020](https://academic.oup.com/cid/advance-article/doi/10.1093/cid/ciaa237/5801998)\). 
* March 2020: French researchers report a significant decrease in viral load by nasal swab after treatment with hydroxychloroquine in 20 patients \([Gautret et al. 2020](http://www.mediterranee-infection.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Hydroxychloroquine_final_DOI_IJAA.pdf)\), however, no clinical outcomes, such as mortality, were reported. 
* March 2020: FDA issued EUA for hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine. EUAs are issued when the FDA determines that the known and potential benefits of a drug outweigh the known and potential risks of the product and that there are no alternatives available. This allows physicians to prescribe these drugs for hospitalized patients when appropriate, but it does not mean that the drugs have demonstrated efficacy through clinical testing.

_Ongoing Clinical Trials_:

*  [&gt; 20 ongoing clinical trials](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0883944120303907) in China as of March 10. 
* A post-exposure prophylaxis trial of hydroxychloroquine is underway at the University of Minnesota \([ClinicalTrials.gov 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04308668)\). 
* March 2020: The WHO launches [the SOLIDARITY trial](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/who-launches-global-megatrial-four-most-promising-coronavirus-treatments?fbclid=IwAR301f1WXZM4ypKN0Y1DZtU3OeC-wHOzZPN5XQRukHXx3vtZ59jAwRLnHOY#), a global megatrial of hydroxychloroquine/chloroquine, remdesivir, lopinavir/ritonavir, or lopinavir/ritonavir with interferon-beta \([Science Magazine, 2020](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/who-launches-global-megatrial-four-most-promising-coronavirus-treatments?fbclid=IwAR301f1WXZM4ypKN0Y1DZtU3OeC-wHOzZPN5XQRukHXx3vtZ59jAwRLnHOY#)\). It is an open-label, randomized, adaptive trial designed to be as simple as possible, with the goal of rapid data collection in thousands of patients around the world. A physician will input data directly onto the WHO website, including the treatments available at his or her hospital, and the website will randomize to one of the available treatments or standard of care. INSERM, the French biomedical research agency, will coordinate a European add-on study of the same treatments called DISCOVERY \([ClinicalTrials.gov 2020](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04315948?recrs=af&cond=COVID-19&draw=3)\).

_Implications_: Hydroxychloroquine is a widely available drug, whereas chloroquine is currently in limited supply in the U.S.. If proven clinically efficacious, its implementation would be relatively straightforward. 

_Future Questions_: Interim trial results of ongoing trials will provide important information on efficacy.

#### **Remdesivir**

Nucleotide analog developed for Ebola and Marburg \(dropped for clinical inferiority \[[Mulangu et al. 2019](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1910993?utm_source=The+Scope&utm_campaign=726e5321e8-Weekly_Scope_Jan_12_2018_COPY_01&utm_medium=email&utm_term=0_809ad7d22b-726e5321e8-180799253)\] but has an established safety profile\). 

_Recent Findings:_

* February 2020: Wang et al. demonstrated that remdesivir possesses antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2 in vitro \([Wang et al., Nature 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41422-020-0282-0)\). 
* March 2020: Holshue et al. describe a case report of the ‘compassionate use’ of remdesivir in one of the first patients in the United States, who had clinical improvement after critical illness \([Holsue et al., NEJM 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001191)\).

_Ongoing Clinical Trials:_ 

* [Multiple randomized trials of remdesivir](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=covid+19&term=remdesivir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) expect results by April or May 2020 \(recruiting in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Korea, and the United States\). 
* In the United States, a large multicenter [NIH adaptive randomized controlled trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04280705?cond=adaptive+trial+COVID-19&draw=2&rank=1) is investigating remdesivir,  [as are two additional multicenter randomized trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=COVID-19&term=remdesivir&cntry=US&state=&city=&dist=&Search=Search) sponsored by Gilead, recruiting moderate and severe cases. 
* The SOLIDARITY and DISCOVERY trials include remdesivir \(see details under hydroxychloroquine above\).

_Implications_: Remdesivir is a prominent candidate due to its high efficacy against all coronaviruses \(it was considered the most promising in the [WHO’s R&D Blueprint Report](https://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/handle/10665/330680/WHO-HEO-RDBlueprint%28nCoV%29-2020.1-eng.pdf?ua=1)\) and the robust clinical safety exhibited in the Ebola virus trials.

_Future Questions:_

1. Trials underway are investigating optimal length of infusion with a loading dose followed by 5 or 10 days. 
2. Is remdesivir most efficacious for mild, moderate, or severe disease? Trials underway are recruiting patients based on disease severity. 
3. Given the mechanism of action of remdesivir, why is it considered to be so promising? 

#### **Lopinavir/Ritonavir** 

HIV Protease inhibitor 

_Recent Findings:_ 

* March 2020: a case series in Singapore with 3 out of 5 patients treated with lopinavir/ritonavir exhibiting improvements in fever and need for supplemental oxygen \([Young et al., JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2762688)\). 
* March 2020: in a randomized controlled open label trial in 199 patients in Wuhan, China with enrollment from January 18 - February 3, there was no observed benefit of lopinavir/ritonavir over standard of care in terms of viral load, time to clinical improvement, or mortality \([Cao et al., NEJM 2020\)](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2001282?fbclid=IwAR1Ikh2t3S1hThz7d8FZQqHY0wdXYlKZWe96w5UZuebbdWPZ__6lSoGy7K8).

_Ongoing Clinical Trials:_ 

* [Multiple trials](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/results?cond=Coronavirus&term=lopinavir&cntry=&state=&city=&dist=) involving lopinavir/ritonavir in comparison to and/or in combination with arbidol, ribavirin, interferon-beta, umifenovir, hydroxychloroquine, and additional protease inhibitors are ongoing. 
* The SOLIDARITY and DISCOVERY trials include lopinavir/ritonavir alone and in combination with interferon-beta as treatment arms \(see details under hydroxychloroquine above\).

_Future Questions:_ Whether these drugs alone or in combination have an effect on COVID-19 remains to be determined and is currently being investigated with larger sample sizes in clinical trials.

#### **IL-6 Inhibition**

Humanized monoclonal antibodies against the interleukin-6 receptor, including tocilizumab and sarilumab. 

_Recent Findings:_

* March 2020: Xu et al. described that in 15 out of 20 patients, treatment with tocilizumab showed rapid resolution of symptoms, prompting China to approve the use of tocilizumab to treat patients with severe or critical disease \([Xu et al., ChinXiv 2020](http://www.chinaxiv.org/abs/202003.00026)\).

_Ongoing Clinical Trials_: 

* The WHO registry currently lists three studies \([one RCT](http://www.chictr.org.cn/showprojen.aspx?proj=49409)\) taking place in China, using tocilizumab as the primary intervention for the treatment of COVID-19. 
* A randomized study on [sarilumab](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04315298?recrs=af&cond=COVID-19&draw=3) will also begin in the U.S.

_Future Questions:_ High levels of IL-6 appear to correlate with disease severity \([Liu et al., bioRxiv preprint, 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.01.20029769v2)\). More studies need to be conducted to explore this relationship. Does this mean that IL-6 is causing harm?

### Antibody treatments

These treatments are based on the idea that immunity can be transferred from one person to another by providing an antibody developed in someone \(or an animal\) previously exposed to the SARS-CoV-2 virus or a virus similar to SARS-CoV-2 to a previously unexposed \(and thus unprotected immunologically\) to the virus. Different approaches are currently being used \([A detailed guide to the coronavirus drugs and vaccines in development](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-drugs-and-vaccines-in-development/)\):

* Regeneron Pharmaceuticals: Using antibody-generating mice exposed to a harmless analogue of SARS-CoV-2, they aim to find a potent antibody that provides immunity in these mice to SARS-CoV-2. The hope is that these antibodies can also be given to humans to fight against the SARS-CoV-2 virus. During the Ebola outbreak in 2015, Regeneron Pharmaceuticals used a similar approach to develop a treatment for Ebola that significantly improved[ the survival rate](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa1910993). 
* Vir Biotechnology: By isolating antibodies from patients who survived SARS \(which is a coronavirus related to the novel SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus\), they hope to determine whether these antibodies against SARS provide some benefit against this new related SARS-CoV-2 virus.

_Recent Findings:_ 

* March 2020: The FDA [temporarily authorized](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds) the use of convalescent plasma \(transfusion of plasma from recovered COVID-19 patients to those who are severely ill, see details in [Module 1: Passive Antibody Transfer](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo/preview#heading=h.q4zelof2m8jm)\) through the emergency Investigational New Drug Applications \(eINDs\) exemption. This allows for a case-by-case request to the FDA for treatment of life-threatening cases while clinical trials for convalescent plasma begin under the traditional IND pathway. No formal clinical trial data exists yet for COVID-19, but a preprint pilot study in 10 severely ill patients performed in China revealed that transfusion was well tolerated and that, in 7 out of 10 patients, viral load became undetectable one week after treatment \([Duan et al;, preprint medRxIV 2020](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.03.16.20036145v1)\). Another case-series study in China demonstrated improvement in five patients with severe COVID-19 after treatment with convalescent plasma \([Shen et al. JAMA 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763983)\). Importantly, this study has several limitations: there was no control arm and patients also received other antiviral treatments.

## Vaccines

For background on vaccines and their development, please see [Module 1: Vaccine Development](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/investigational-therapeutics-and-vaccine-development#vaccine-development).

Many pharmaceutical companies and governments are currently in the process of developing SARS-CoV-2 vaccines, and strategies with all of the above vaccine types are being utilized \([Pang et al., JCM 2020](https://www.mdpi.com/2077-0383/9/3/623/htm)\).

Potential mRNA and DNA vaccines have been developed more quickly because these only require knowing the [genetic sequence](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/sars-cov-2-seqs/#nucleotide-sequences) of SARS-CoV-2 \(which was identified and quickly uploaded by Chinese researchers in January\), whereas whole pathogen vaccines require growing the virus and subunit vaccines require protein production in a laboratory. Specific promising vaccines in development include \([A detailed guide to the coronavirus drugs and vaccines in development](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/02/coronavirus-drugs-and-vaccines-in-development/)\):

* Moderna Therapeutics: mRNA vaccine
  * Moderna Therapeutics has developed a potential mRNA vaccine \(mRNA-1273\) for SARS-CoV-2. The use of this vaccine entered a Phase 1 study on March 16, 2020 conducted by Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute in Seattle. The goals of this study are to determine the safety & immunogenicity of the supposed vaccine and not the ability to prevent COVID-19 infection. The study involves 45 healthy adults aged 18-55 who each receive two injections of mRNA-1273 28 days apart. The group is also split up into 3 different series of dosages being tested. Moderna is the first company attempting to use mRNA as a basis for vaccine development. While they have several other vaccines using this technology in development \(H10N8, H7N9, RSV, chikungunya virus, hMPV/PIV3 and CMV\), there are no vaccines currently on the market that utilize this strategy for prophylactic vaccine treatment.
* Bacillus Calmette-Guerin \(BCG\) vaccine:
  * Based on [limited evidence](https://www.bmj.com/content/355/bmj.i5170), it is hypothesized that the BCG vaccine, first developed in the early 20th century to prevent tuberculosis, may stimulate the immune system in a way that reduces the risk of any given infection. These findings have mainly been observational or in very limited clinical trials. It is thought that the BCG vaccine may upregulate activation of the innate immune system’s macrophages, neutrophils, and natural killer \(NK\) cells, inducing heightened immune responses against all pathogens. This concept is distinct from the general principle of vaccination, in which long-lasting, specific immunity to a pathogen is achieved through antigen-specific activation of the adaptive immune system’s T- and B-cells. Currently, [clinical trials](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2020/03/can-century-old-tb-vaccine-steel-immune-system-against-new-coronavirus) are beginning with healthcare workers and the elderly in the Netherlands, Australia, England, and Germany.
