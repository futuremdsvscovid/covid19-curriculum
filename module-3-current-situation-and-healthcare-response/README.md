* [The vaccine development section has been reformatted for standardization,   new updates added](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/ongoing-clinical-trials#vaccines)
* [Update on remdesivir case study results](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/ongoing-clinical-trials#2-remdesivir); [favipiravir added as another investigational agent](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/ongoing-clinical-trials#5-favipiravir) 
* [Additional states added as case studies: Michigan and Alabama](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/state-responses-selected-case-studies)

In Module 3 of this curriculum, students will begin to consider the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, locally and globally. The first section of the module will walk students through the current landscape of the pandemic locally in Massachusetts. In order to stay up-to-date, this section will provide students with several useful links, so that real time data may be accessed. In the next two sections, students will see how the basic science principles behind COVID-19 diagnosis, investigational therapeutics, and vaccines \(discussed in [Module 1](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1gjUuqTLi7xqMVzgWeYAFulmaIiKzhYY89PVOJJVvlNo/edit?ts=5e743689)\) are currently being implemented. We will review the status of testing in the United States regarding capacity and eligibility, as well as the most recent data on various therapies and vaccines. Next,  students will receive a general overview of how the pandemic impacts social and financial aspects of daily life, with a focus on implications for care outside of COVID-19, and the overall economic impact, policy changes, state-by-state comparisons, and health disparities involving COVID-19. While these final sections are by no means complete reviews, we hope that they will invite further consideration of the broader scope of the pandemic. We expect that this module will take **two hours** to complete.  


## Overarching Learning Goal:

Appreciate the complex and rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic as it stands in the U.S., as well as the adapting responses of the healthcare system and society as a whole.

## Learning Objectives:

At the end of this module, medical students should be able to:

* Access useful sources on the current landscape for coronavirus infection in Massachusetts and the United States
* Illustrate how practical considerations of a healthcare system impact testing capacity and eligibility
* Describe the current landscape of clinical trials on experimental antiviral treatments, pharmaceuticals, and vaccine development 
* Explain how COVID-19â€™s impact on the healthcare system affects patients who are not infected with the virus and certain high-risk groups
* Appreciate the ways in which pre-existing health disparities exacerbate COVID-19 infection
* Identify at least three different ways in which the pandemic has impacted the global economic and social climate
* Compare and contrast state and local responses to the pandemic
