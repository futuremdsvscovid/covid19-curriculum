In Module 3 of this curriculum, students will begin to consider the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic, locally and globally. The first section of the module will walk students through the current landscape of the pandemic locally in Massachusetts. In order to stay up-to-date, this section will provide students with several useful links, so that real time data may be accessed. In the next two sections, students will see how the basic science principles behind COVID-19 diagnosis, investigational therapeutics, and vaccines \(discussed in [Module 1](https://futuremdvscovid.gitbook.io/covid19-curriculum/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside)\) are currently being implemented-- the status of testing in the United States regarding capacity and eligibility, and the most recent data on various therapies and vaccines. Finally, students will receive a general overview of how the pandemic may impact the social and financial aspects of daily life. While the final section is by no means a complete review, we hope that this will invite further consideration of the broader scope of the pandemic. We expect that this module will take **2 hours** to complete.

## **Overarching Learning Goal:**

Appreciate the complex and rapidly changing landscape of the COVID-19 pandemic as it stands in Massachusetts, as well as the adapting responses of the healthcare system and society as a whole.

## Learning Objectives:

At the end of this module, medical students should be able to:

* Access useful sources on the current landscape for coronavirus infection in Massachusetts
* Illustrate how practical considerations of a healthcare system impact testing capacity and eligibility
* Describe the current landscape of clinical trials on experimental antiviral treatments and vaccine development 
* Identify at least three different ways in which the pandemic has impacted the global economic and social climate
