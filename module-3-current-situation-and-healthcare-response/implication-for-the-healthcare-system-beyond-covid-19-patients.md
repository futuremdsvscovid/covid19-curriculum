# Implication for the Healthcare System Beyond COVID-19 Patients

## **Routine and chronic care**

The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the way patients and providers interact within the healthcare system. Routine care has shifted towards telemedicine, which both reduces the risk of viral transmission and preserves the healthcare workforce. In addition to audio and visual virtual visits for established outpatients, telemedicine can be used in triage for patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and for monitoring in the ICU setting \([Hollander and Carr, 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2003539)\). Prior to March 2020, reimbursement for telehealth services was limited. In light of the COVID-19 public health emergency and urgent need for social distancing, on March 6, 2020, Medicare expanded telehealth coverage to “[office, hospital, and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country and including in patient’s places of residence.](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet)” While this expansion in coverage is temporary, the widespread implementation of telehealth during this crisis will likely change the landscape of telemedicine in the future.

 The use of telemedicine is just one way that COVID-19 has impacted routine care and care of patients with chronic conditions. Because patients with chronic conditions are more likely to develop complications from COVID-19, they are advised to be extra cautious in taking necessary precautions such as social distancing and handwashing. In one example, [Fenway Health](https://fenwayhealth.org/fenway-health-policy-brief-outlines-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-living-with-hiv-and-lgbtqia-people/) advised patients with HIV to confirm their flu and pneumonia vaccines are up to date, that a 30-day \(or more\) supply of their medication is available on hand, and that they pay special attention to treatment adherence. 

Impacts beyond direct COVID-19 infection include postponement of non-urgent procedures, dental care, and some appointments; relocation of ambulatory and specialty staff to the inpatient setting; and healthcare worker shortages as healthcare workers become ill or are required to self-quarantine. In Massachusetts, Governor Baker has asked medical schools to allow [early graduation](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/26/massachusetts-medical-schools-to-graduate-students-early-to-fight-coronavirus-pandemic/) to augment the healthcare workforce. As demands on healthcare workers grow, it is important to consider the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on the physical and mental health of these frontline workers. Physical exhaustion, increased workplace demands, anxiety over personal illness or viral transmission, viral infection, and ethical dilemmas are just some of the stressors outlined by the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/covid/COVID_healthcare_workers.asp)

## **The role of skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes**

Nursing homes became an [area of focus](https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763666) in the COVID-19 pandemic following the initial outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home in late February and early March. Both residents and staff experienced high rates of infection, and 35 residents died as a result. Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities \(SNFs\) present a potent combination of factors predisposing them to widespread outbreaks of severe disease, including population density, elderly and frail residents with multiple comorbidities, and staff that travels from room to room to care for residents. If staff fall ill, they can easily transmit the virus from resident to resident and often feel pressure to continue working due to short staffing and lack of paid sick leave. 

Furthermore, infection control is the most common [area of deficiency](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/data-note-how-might-coronavirus-affect-residents-in-nursing-facilities/) reported in nursing facilities. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-long-term-care-facilities.html) has concluded that most nursing home outbreaks are the result of visitors, staff, or healthcare providers importing the virus before it is spread between residents. As a result, the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-measures-protect-nursing-home-residents-covid-19) has instituted a nationwide no-visitor policy across nursing homes and SNFs. It has also restricted the presence of non-essential staff and volunteers and cancelled all communal and group activities, including meals. As interaction and communal time are at the core of many nursing homes’ missions, this has radically changed the way residents live and interact. 

Elderly and home-bound individuals are already at higher risk for social isolation and loneliness, and restricting their ability to see loved ones has been controversial. If an outbreak occurs, it is often challenging to move and re-group sick individuals in order to isolate them from those who are not ill. Finally, it is important to note that nursing homes and SNFs represent only part of the spectrum of care for aging populations. [Assisted living facilities](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/25/assisted-living-covid-19-kirkland-nursing-home/) have many of the same vulnerabilities as nursing homes. As a result of more independent residents and lack of clear guidance from CMS, these facilities may be the next hotspots for outbreaks.
