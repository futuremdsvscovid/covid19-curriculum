# Implication for the Healthcare System Beyond COVID-19 Patients

## **Routine and chronic care**

The COVID-19 outbreak has changed the way patients and providers interact within the healthcare system. Routine care has shifted towards telemedicine, which both reduces the risk of viral transmission and preserves the healthcare workforce. In addition to audio and visual virtual visits for established outpatients, telemedicine can be used in triage for patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and for monitoring in the ICU setting \([Hollander and Carr, 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2003539)\). Prior to March 2020, reimbursement for telehealth services was limited. In light of the COVID-19 public health emergency and urgent need for social distancing, on March 6, 2020, Medicare expanded telehealth coverage to “[office, hospital, and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country and including in patient’s places of residence.](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet)” While this expansion in coverage is temporary, the widespread implementation of telehealth during this crisis will likely change the landscape of telemedicine in the future.

The use of telemedicine is just one way that COVID-19 has impacted routine care and care of patients with chronic conditions. Because patients with chronic conditions are more likely to develop complications from COVID-19, they are advised to be extra cautious in taking necessary precautions such as social distancing and handwashing. In one example, [Fenway Health](https://fenwayhealth.org/fenway-health-policy-brief-outlines-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-living-with-hiv-and-lgbtqia-people/) advised patients with HIV to confirm their flu and pneumonia vaccines are up to date, that a 30-day \(or more\) supply of their medication is available on hand, and that they pay special attention to treatment adherence. 

Impacts beyond direct COVID-19 infection include postponement of non-urgent procedures, dental care, and some appointments; relocation of ambulatory and specialty staff to the inpatient setting; and healthcare worker shortages as healthcare workers become ill or are required to self-quarantine. In Massachusetts, medical schools have [graduated their fourth year students early ](https://www.bostonherald.com/2020/03/26/massachusetts-medical-schools-to-graduate-students-early-to-fight-coronavirus-pandemic/)to augment the healthcare workforce. As demands on healthcare workers grow, it is important to consider the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on the physical and mental health of these frontline workers. Physical exhaustion, increased workplace demands, anxiety over personal illness or viral transmission, viral infection, and ethical dilemmas are just some of the stressors outlined by the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/covid/COVID_healthcare_workers.asp) An upcoming module will discuss the impact of COVID-19 on mental health in more detail.

## **The role of skilled nursing facilities and nursing homes**

Nursing homes became an [area of focus](https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763666) in the COVID-19 pandemic following the initial outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home in late February and early March. Both residents and staff experienced high rates of infection, and 35 residents died as a result. Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities \(SNFs\) present a potent combination of factors predisposing them to widespread outbreaks of severe disease, including population density, elderly and frail residents with multiple comorbidities, and staff who travel from room to room to care for residents. If staff become infected, they can easily transmit the virus from resident to resident and even if ill may still feel pressure to continue working due to short staffing and lack of paid sick leave. 

Furthermore, infection control is the most common [area of deficiency](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/data-note-how-might-coronavirus-affect-residents-in-nursing-facilities/) reported in nursing facilities. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-long-term-care-facilities.html) has concluded that most nursing home outbreaks are the result of visitors, staff, or healthcare providers importing the virus before it is spread between residents. As a result, the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-announces-new-measures-protect-nursing-home-residents-covid-19) has instituted a nationwide no-visitor policy across nursing homes and SNFs. It has also restricted the presence of non-essential staff and volunteers and cancelled all communal and group activities, including meals. As interaction and communal time are at the core of many nursing homes’ missions, this has radically changed the way residents live and interact. 

The [Holyoke Soldiers Home](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/02/veterans-holyoke-soldiers-home-staff-union-accounts) in western Massachusetts offers a stark picture of what can occur when there are insufficient preparations and precautions for an outbreak in a nursing home. After a resident on a memory care unit started showing symptoms in mid-March, it took several days to initiate testing, with little to no isolation or protection for fellow residents and staff. Instead of distancing residents, fewer staff members were asked to care for a greater number of residents. [This editorial](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/06/opinion/bakers-perception-vs-reality-holyoke-soldiers-home/) argues against Governor Baker’s ignorance of the situation at this nursing home, claiming that he should have been more prepared. As of April 6, 25 residents had died, 18 of whom tested positive for COVID-19.

Elderly and home-bound individuals are already at higher risk for social isolation and loneliness, and restricting their ability to see loved ones has been controversial. If an outbreak occurs, it is often challenging to move and re-group sick individuals in order to isolate them from those who are not ill. Finally, it is important to note that nursing homes and SNFs represent only part of the spectrum of care for aging populations. [Assisted living facilities](https://www.statnews.com/2020/03/25/assisted-living-covid-19-kirkland-nursing-home/) have many of the same vulnerabilities as nursing homes. As a result of more independent residents and lack of clear guidance from CMS, these facilities may be the next hotspots for outbreaks.

As hospitals reach capacity, some are looking to nursing homes and SNFs as potential sites for patient overflow or patients with COVID-19 requiring [post-acute care](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763818). States have taken [different approaches](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2020/03/31/states-are-beginning-to-move-covid-19-patients-from-hospitals-to-nursing-facilities/#158c53994401), with New York ordering all nursing homes to accept patients regardless of COVID-19 status, and Massachusetts designating specific facilities for patients recovering from COVID-19 and relocating patients without COVID-19 to other facilities. CMS has temporarily lifted the “three day rule” for reimbursement, allowing patients to move more quickly between hospitals and SNFs. In addition, the suspension of elective surgeries has freed space in SNFs usually occupied by patients recovering from procedures such as hip and knee replacements. 

Moving patients from the acute care setting provides needed beds but may expose the densely populated and highly vulnerable residents of the facilities into which they move. Strategies requiring separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 populations rely on widespread testing availability, which remains a challenge in most of the U.S. Critics argue that requiring testing before moving patients would not only slow the relocation process, but would also be an inefficient use of scarce testing resources. Experts suggest that encouraging home recovery as much as possible will help to relieve strain on both hospital and nursing home capacities, as well as decrease the risk of disease spread within these facilities. [Additional solutions](https://khn.org/news/coronavirus-patients-caught-in-conflict-between-hospital-and-nursing-homes/) for temporary post-acute care settings are surfacing around the country, with many focusing on currently unused buildings such as previously closed hospitals and nursing homes, college dorms, and even summer camps.
