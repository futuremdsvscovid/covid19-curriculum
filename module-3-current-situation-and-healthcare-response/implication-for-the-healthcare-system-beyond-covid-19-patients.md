# Implications for the Healthcare System Beyond COVID-19 Patients

## Routine, Chronic, and Non-Essential Care & Telemedicine

Routine care has shifted towards telemedicine, which both reduces the risk of viral transmission and preserves the healthcare workforce. In addition to audio and visual virtual visits for established outpatients, telemedicine can be used in triage for patients exhibiting COVID-19 symptoms and monitoring in the ICU setting \([Hollander and Carr, 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2003539)\). Prior to March 2020, reimbursement for telehealth services was limited. In light of the COVID-19 public health emergency and urgent need for social distancing, on March 6, 2020, CMS expanded telehealth coverage to “[office, hospital, and other visits furnished via telehealth across the country and including in patient’s places of residence.](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/fact-sheets/medicare-telemedicine-health-care-provider-fact-sheet)” While this expansion in coverage is temporary, the widespread implementation of telehealth during this crisis will likely change the landscape of telemedicine in the future.

Because patients with chronic conditions are more likely to develop complications, they are advised to be extra cautious in taking necessary precautions such as social distancing and handwashing. In one example, [Fenway Health](https://fenwayhealth.org/fenway-health-policy-brief-outlines-impact-of-covid-19-on-people-living-with-hiv-and-lgbtqia-people/) advised patients with HIV to confirm that their flu and pneumonia vaccines are up to date, that a 30-day \(or more\) supply of their medication is available on hand, and that they pay special attention to treatment adherence. In another example, oncologists carefully balance the timing and benefit of various cancer treatments with the risk of infection and hospital admission \([Shrag et al, 2020](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2764728)\).

Many non-urgent  procedures have also been postponed. On April 19, CMS released guidelines on how to re-open some non-essential procedures. Other impacts include dental care, appointments, relocation of ambulatory and specialty staff to the inpatient setting, and healthcare worker shortages as healthcare workers become ill or are required to self-quarantine. In several states, medical schools have graduated their fourth year students early to augment the healthcare workforce. As demands on healthcare workers grow, it is important to consider the implications of the COVID-19 outbreak on the physical and mental health of these frontline workers. Physical exhaustion, increased workplace demands, anxiety over personal illness or viral transmission, viral infection, and ethical dilemmas are just some of the stressors outlined by the [U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs.](https://www.ptsd.va.gov/covid/COVID_healthcare_workers.asp) Please see Module 5: Care for Self and Others During Crisis for a more in-depth discussion of the  impact of COVID-19 on mental health.

## The Role of Skilled Nursing Facilities and Nursing Homes

Nursing homes became an [area of focus](https://jamanetwork.com/channels/health-forum/fullarticle/2763666) in the COVID-19 pandemic following the initial outbreak at a Seattle-area nursing home in late February and early March. Nursing homes and skilled nursing facilities \(SNFs\) present a unique combination of factors that predispose them to widespread outbreaks of severe disease, including population density, elderly and frail residents with multiple comorbidities, and staff that travels among rooms to care for residents. If staff fall ill, they can easily transmit the virus from resident to resident and often feel pressure to continue working due to short staffing and/or lack of paid sick leave. 

Infection control is the most common [area of deficiency](https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/data-note-how-might-coronavirus-affect-residents-in-nursing-facilities/) reported in nursing facilities. The [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/healthcare-facilities/prevent-spread-in-long-term-care-facilities.html) has concluded that most nursing home outbreaks are the result of visitors, staff, or healthcare providers importing the virus before it spreads between residents. As a result, CMS has instituted a nationwide no-visitor policy across nursing homes and SNFs. It has also restricted the presence of non-essential staff and volunteers and cancelled all communal and group activities, including meals. 

The [Holyoke Soldiers Home](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/02/veterans-holyoke-soldiers-home-staff-union-accounts) in western Massachusetts offers a stark picture of what can occur when there are insufficient preparations and precautions for an outbreak in a nursing home. After a memory care unit resident started showing symptoms in mid-March, it took several days to initiate testing, with little to no isolation or protection for fellow residents and staff. Instead of distancing residents, fewer staff members were asked to care for a greater number of residents. [This editorial](https://www.bostonglobe.com/2020/04/06/opinion/bakers-perception-vs-reality-holyoke-soldiers-home/) argues against Governor Baker’s ignorance of the situation at this nursing home, claiming that he should have been more prepared. As of [April 21](https://www.westernmassnews.com/news/the-latest-state-reports-40-resident-deaths-at-holyoke-soldiers-home/article_88b3a4d8-791d-11ea-b3b7-f37420fe3e63.html), 63 residents had died, 52 of whom tested positive for COVID.

As hospitals reach capacity, some are looking to nursing homes and SNFs as potential sites for patient overflow or patients with COVID-19 requiring [post-acute care](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama/fullarticle/2763818). States have taken [different approaches](https://www.forbes.com/sites/howardgleckman/2020/03/31/states-are-beginning-to-move-covid-19-patients-from-hospitals-to-nursing-facilities/#158c53994401), with New York ordering all nursing homes to accept patients regardless of COVID-19 status, and Massachusetts designating specific facilities for patients recovering from COVID-19 and relocating patients without COVID-19 to other facilities. CMS has temporarily lifted the “three day rule” for reimbursement, allowing patients to move more quickly between hospitals and SNFs. In addition, the suspension of elective surgeries has freed space in SNFs usually occupied by patients recovering from elective orthopedic procedures. Moving patients from the acute care setting provides needed beds but may expose the densely populated and highly vulnerable residents of the facilities into which they move. Strategies requiring separation of COVID-19 and non-COVID-19 populations rely on widespread testing availability, which remains a challenge in most of the U.S. [Additional solutions](https://khn.org/news/coronavirus-patients-caught-in-conflict-between-hospital-and-nursing-homes/) for temporary post-acute care settings are surfacing around the country, with many focusing on currently unused buildings such as previously closed hospitals and nursing homes, college dorms, and even summer camps.

## Healthcare Workers Becoming Sick

 COVID-19 has affected a high proportion of healthcare workers. In Italy’s Lombardy region, at one point [9%](https://www.icn.ch/news/high-proportion-healthcare-workers-covid-19-italy-stark-warning-world-protecting-nurses-and) of COVID-19 cases were healthcare workers. Academic articles studying infections in China have proposed a number of reasons for these increased infections: lack of knowledge about the virus and inadequate personal protection at the beginning of the outbreak, subsequent PPE shortage, suboptimal hand hygiene after exposure to infected patients, high exposure to the virus, and long work hours in high-risk environments \([Wang et al, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7134479/#__ffn_sectitle) and [Ran et al, 2020](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/32179890)\). Many of these issues apply to the U.S., especially in areas such as New York. [Thousands](https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/zahrahirji/us-health-care-workers-coronavirus) of healthcare workers in the U.S. have tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, and some have already [passed away](https://www.modernhealthcare.com/people/uw-medicine-pathology-professor-dies-covid-19). Thus far, it is unknown whether the mortality rate is higher for healthcare workers than for the general population.

### Thought question:

* What types of public health and health care delivery interventions introduced during this crisis have staying power \(e.g. telemedicine, expansion of sick leave\), and why?
