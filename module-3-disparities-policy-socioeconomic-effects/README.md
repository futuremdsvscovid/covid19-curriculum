**Highlight of Updates \(4/25/2020\):**

**\*\*Not yet reviewed by all faculty reviewers\*\***

* New section on health disparities
* New section on health policy framework and major players
* Updated policy responses

In Module 3 of this curriculum, students will begin to consider the broader implications of the COVID-19 pandemic. In the first section of this module, students will engage with a discussion on health disparities and how the pandemic has pulled back the curtain on these disparities. In the next section, students will learn how state and federal governments, in addition to insurers, are able to respond to public health crises and the actions they have taken thus far in addressing the COVID-19 pandemic.  Taking this information a step further, we have provided state by state case studies to allow students to compare and contrast the various responses across the country. Finally, students will receive a general overview of how the pandemic impacts healthcare that is not associated with COVID-19, in addition to many social and economic aspects of daily life. While these sections are by no means complete reviews, we hope that they will invite further consideration of the broader scope of the pandemic. We expect that this module will take **2 hours** to complete.

* Appreciate the way in which disparities contribute to COVID-19 health outcomes
* Identify three major federal health policy stakeholders and federal legislation that has been implemented to address the COVID-19 pandemic
* Compare and contrast state and local responses to the pandemic, identifying attributes associated with “hotspots”
