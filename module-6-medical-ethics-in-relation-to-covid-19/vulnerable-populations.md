# Vulnerable Populations

## Overview

This section will discuss ethical questions that are particularly relevant to a range of vulnerable patient populations. By “vulnerable,” we mean patients who may be at particular risk of suffering physical or mental health consequences, financial hardship, or discrimination. Vulnerable populations may require additional aid and protection during a time of crisis, and, yet, can often be forgotten when public health measures are enacted for the population as a whole. This section will remind us of crucial issues and concerns affecting vulnerable groups.

## Homeless and Low-Income Populations

The low-income and homeless populations are particularly vulnerable in the era of pandemics due to their reliance on social support structures, more tenuous income streams, and a variety of other factors.

Many people with low income will not have disposable income or economic savings, as prior to the pandemic, many will have lived paycheck to paycheck. Thus, it will be no surprise that the economic impacts of COVID-19 affect the low- income population the most. To start, there is a higher proportion of individuals in this socioeconomic class that will have jobs that cannot be translated into remote work, such as jobs in the manufacturing, retail, transportation, and restaurant industry. Moreover, it should not be forgotten that socioeconomic status has also been correlated [with a greater burden of chronic disease](https://www.who.int/chp/chronic_disease_report/part2_ch2/en/), a factor that can make one more susceptible to the virus. A 2018 paper by [Kapiriri and Ross](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s40609-018-0123-y), which discussed the socioeconomic distribution of disease of prior epidemics such as SARS, Zika and Ebola, highlighted the influence of privilege on the experience of an epidemic. The review found that infectious disease outbreaks disproportionately affect the poor, specifically communities that have limited access to health services. It is likely that COVID-19 will have similar effects.

For the homeless population, the question arises how we can best address the needs of a population that has little to no control over their environment. How does one shelter in place, for instance, if one does not have a permanent shelter? Social distancing is virtually impossible for someone who has to remain in public spaces or in overcrowded homeless shelters. 

Even marginal economic relief to a large number of these individuals would be in line with the utilitarian argument of providing the greatest good for the greatest number of people. However, amidst a pandemic when there will be other pressures to provide funding for other worthy causes, such as medical resources, the low-income and homeless populations can be easily marginalized. This marginalization has the potential to become even more pronounced if these individuals experience greater morbidity due to the virus because of baseline health risks.

_Thought Questions:_ 

* What long-term impacts on these populations can you predict months to years after the pandemic? 
* What are some novel solutions to protect the homeless population from the risk of the virus if the CDC recommendations are often challenging to implement? 

## **Children** 

While it is predicted that, from a disease morbidity standpoint, children will be less affected by COVID-19, the downstream implications on this  population should not be forgotten. The most obvious impact may be on educational progress. According to [UNESCO](https://en.unesco.org/themes/education-emergencies/coronavirus-school-closures), as of March 23rd, 2020, more than 1.3 billion learners were out of school due to COVID-19. While teachers and school boards are dedicated to continuing a child’s educational year, digital learning is an imperfect system, especially for children that do not have access to internet or have had to step into new roles \(childcare, cooking, etc.\) due to the pressures on the adult population. [Wang et al. \(2020\)](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736%2820%2930547-X/fulltext) stress that, when kids are out of school, they are less active, have longer screen time, and have irregular sleep patterns.  Moreover, the article points out that the psychological impact of such prolonged isolation must not be forgotten. [Sprang and Silman \(2013\)](https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/disaster-medicine-and-public-health-preparedness/article/posttraumatic-stress-disorder-in-parents-and-youth-after-healthrelated-disasters/4F3E4300F74CEEAFA8EE95E490944888) showed that the mean posttraumatic stress scores were four times higher in children that had been quarantined than in those who had not. Lastly, the livelihood of children is closely connected to that of the adult population, which is being severely affected by the pandemic. For instance, parents who continue to work outside of the home may have difficulty finding childcare, as schools and daycare centers remain closed.

The pediatric population is a dependent, and thus vulnerable, population. The ethical discussion then becomes how one thinks through the allocation of resources to a population that will experience profound repercussions from the pandemic but 1\) will be less affected from a purely health standpoint and 2\) does not directly contribute to the economy.  While many argue that there will be a substantial trickle-down effect of supporting the caregivers of children, and thus, this should be the population targeted with funding and resources, it could be argued that failure to address the specific pediatric repercussions of COVID-19 will have substantial impact, which will continue to be felt far into the future. 

_Thought Questions:_

* Once things return to the status quo, how do we best repair the educational and psychological stressors that children face during this period?
* Is a dependent population that is not directly linked to economic productivity inherently less deserving of resources during a pandemic?

## **People with Physical and Developmental Disabilities** 

Societal responsibility towards people with disabilities has been a focus of discussion when situations such as pandemics or mass disasters arise and forces us to decide the most efficient and moral ways to distribute help. Experiences from [Hurricane Katrina](https://ncd.gov/publications/2006/Aug072006) have highlighted a disproportionate effect on people with disabilities in dire circumstances. Several U.S. states have proposed guidelines for resource allocation during crises with limitations for certain groups; most notably, [Alabama](http://www.adph.org/CEP/assets/VENTTRIAGE.pdf) has outlined an emergency allocation plan that deems people with severe intellectual disability as “unlikely candidates” for ventilators. [Several arguments](https://scholarship.law.ufl.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1110&context=flr) have been made against the allocation of scarce resources to the disabled. These arguments propose that people with disabilities require extended time of resource use, “have a limited long-term prognosis as a result of their disabilities,” and, in some cases, might have limited benefit from the medical intervention due to a pre-existing disability.  

People with disabilities may not always require additional resources, however, and we must be careful not to let unconscious bias prevent us from prioritizing this population. As Edmund G. Howe discusses in [A Possible Application of Care-Based Ethics to People with Disabilities during a Pandemic,](http://www.clinicalethics.com.ezp-prod1.hul.harvard.edu/archives/201021401.pdf) care-providers experience “unwarranted pessimism” in seeing people with disabilities as “less likely to be happy with their life than is the case.” He also argues that non-disabled persons may have a tendency to “reflexively want to distance themselves from people with particularly visible and evident disabilities. _Thus, a policy regarding equality of access to treatment during a pandemic may be particularly warranted.”_ 

In his [New York Times Op-Ed](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/opinion/coronavirus-ventilators-triage-disability.html), Ari Ne’eman, a disability rights activist, advocates for a “first come first served” approach in efforts to avoid discriminatory behavior in healthcare delivery, especially during the COVID-19 crisis. Although he recognizes the sacrifice imposed by this approach, he argues that there is value in maintaining certain moral principles, explaining, _“I believe that nondiscrimination is not just a tool to accomplish an end — it also is an end in and of itself.”_

_Thought Questions:_ 

* Do you agree with Howe’s argument that care-providers may incorrectly assume that those with disabilities live less happy lives? If so, how do you think this affects their healthcare management? 
* What ethical approach would you implement in your policy and action to avoid discriminatory behaviors against those with disabilities?

## **Pregnant Women Seeking Abortion**

As many states have called for "elective" or non-essential surgeries to halt, some states’ governments have argued that surgical abortions are non-essential and should be stopped to allow personnel and PPE to be re-allocated to the fight against COVID-19. The issue of whether surgical abortions should continue during this crisis strikes at a familiar and important question: is abortion an essential part of women’s healthcare, or is it something that women ‘elect’ to pursue but is not crucial to their health and well-being?

The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, along with other medical professional organizations representing OB/GYNs, published a statement that calls for surgical abortions to continue, as they are a time-sensitive and essential part of women’s healthcare. Governors from conservative states disagree, and a handful of governors have ordered surgical abortions to stop. Others are considering similar action.

In addition to the question of what constitutes "essential care," it is important to consider reasons abortions may be in higher demand during this pandemic. First, women may have difficulty accessing contraception if in quarantine, they have no safe way to travel to a pharmacy, or their pharmacy may have a shortage of their contraceptive medications. Second, [intimate partner violence often increases during disasters](https://www.unwomen.org/en/news/in-focus/in-focus-gender-equality-in-covid-19-response), and there may be higher rate of sexual assault and resulting pregnancies. Third, China has seen an increase in divorce rates after COVID-19, and times of marital instability and financial distress have been linked to greater demand for abortion. If demand for abortion increases while the availability of abortion decreases, many pregnant women seeking abortion will be unable to obtain one during this pandemic.

_Thought Questions:_

* Do you agree that abortion is an essential part of women’s healthcare? Why or why not?
* How should we think about the use of PPE for surgical abortions as compared to other uses during this pandemic? What kind of demand for PPE is posed by an ongoing pregnancy and delivery?

## **Communities Facing Racism and Xenophobia**

All human beings have implicit biases, and clinical providers must keep these biases in check. [It has been demonstrated](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3988900/) that in times of increased stress and panic, such as during a global pandemic, providers are more likely to be influenced by racial prejudices and stereotypes, leading to poorer outcomes for minority populations. While many groups face discrimination on a daily basis, it is important to address the significant increase in anti-Asian sentiment brought on by this pandemic.  \(See related section in [Module 3](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-3-current-situation-and-healthcare-response/socioeconomic-ramifications#social-stigma-and-racism).\)

Notably, this is not the first time the Asian-American community has been targeted due to fears related to [contagious disease](https://www.ucpress.edu/book/9780520226296/contagious-divides). In 1900, as the bubonic plague resurged in California, the increasing Chinese immigrant population in San Francisco became a scapegoat. The San Francisco Board of Health implemented policies for mass quarantine and experimental vaccinations limited to Chinatown. The Chinese population rioted in response to these infringements upon their human rights \([Trauner, 1978](https://www.jstor.org/stable/25157817?seq=1)\).

With regards to the current pandemic, a [report from San Francisco State University](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1mzNEU2ebTF_5OZUon-ovrt36x22nXcuE/view) demonstrated that news coverage of anti-Asian discrimination increased by 50% in February. These reports cited acts against Asian-American individuals and the community at large, as well as xenophobic labels employed by the media and political leaders. Asian-American establishments have seen a particular decline in business. Between January and February, Manhattan’s Chinatown sales [dropped between 40-80%](https://www.mercurynews.com/2020/02/18/asian-american-businesses-suffer-during-virus-fears/), as news of the virus spread in the U.S., even before there were any confirmed cases of COVID-19 in New York City itself. On multiple occasions, President Trump called the virus ["The Chinese Virus,"](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/18/us/politics/china-virus.html) despite recommendations from the [WHO](https://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2015/naming-new-diseases/en/) to avoid geographical descriptors, because prior nomenclature, such as the Middle East Respiratory Syndrome, resulted in stigmatization of particular communities. Amidst these large-scale acts of discrimination, interpersonal attacks have escalated, ranging from accounts of school bullying and verbal harassment to [physical assault](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/23/us/chinese-coronavirus-racist-attacks.html).

Fear may amplify implicit bias, which fuels stigmatizing misconceptions that entire cultural communities are innately more likely to have or spread disease. The [CDC affirms](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/symptoms-testing/reducing-stigma.html) that people of Asian heritage are not at greater risk of spreading COVID-19 than other Americans. They recommend educating people on factual evidence and speaking out against discriminatory behaviors.

_Thought questions:_

* Given widespread anti-Asian sentiment, it is possible that a patient would request to be in a different room from another patient who is of Asian descent. How would you respond to this situation?
* What role do healthcare workers play in mitigating acts of discrimination?
