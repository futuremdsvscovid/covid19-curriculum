# Resource Distribution

## **Overview**

This section will discuss the ethical arguments around scarce resource distribution with a focus on various scenarios that may arise in the COVID-19 pandemic. Briefly, we consider two broad forms of resource allocation: macroallocation and microallocation. Macroallocation determine how a particular society allocates funding and issues policies across areas such as defense, education, infrastructure, public health, and health care. It focuses on the healthcare needs of a population as an aggregate, with distributive justice as the underlying principle. In contrast, microallocation relies on context and individual judgment in the distribution of scarce supplies, such as ventilators and face masks. It uses ethical principles such as those discussed in [Principles of Allocation](https://app.gitbook.com/@futuremdvscovid/s/covid19-curriculum/~/drafts/-M4ykRcFd6O6ulGB4y0r/module-6-medical-ethics-in-relation-to-covid-19/principles-of-allocation) to make decisions among individual cases. In short, macroallocation decisions affect statistical and hypothetical lives, while microallocation decisions affect identified lives.

In this section, we first consider issues of macroallocation involving resource distribution between hospitals, states, and nations that may have differential access to resources or ability to produce them independently. We then turn to various scenarios involving microallocation of personal protective equipment \(PPE\), testing for SARS-CoV-2, and ventilators, all of which may be preferentially directed to certain individuals.  

It is never easy for clinicians to allocate resources, yet we do it all the time. We make choices as to how we spend our time, attention, and energy, the expertise of our specialists and subspecialists, and who we believe can be saved with or without heroic measures. The unfortunate reality is that any scarcity of resources is exacerbated in a time of crisis. Resources are more limited in a time of crisis, requiring decisions that would not ordinarily be made. The scarcity questions that arise in a crisis may be the same as before only to a greater degree \(e.g. patients competing for limited clinician attention\), or they may be different in kind \(e.g. ventilators supply for sick patients is not entertained in normal times\). Furthermore, there are unique features of the COVID-19 pandemic that exacerbate resource shortages. Many of the masks, testing kits, and ventilators in short supply are produced on a regional or even global scale and are affected by stockpiling, supply chain issues, and politics. Since the pandemic is predicted to be limited to a relatively short time period, governments and suppliers face the economic question of whether it is worthwhile to buy or produce more resources if the investment or infrastructure will not be needed in the future. In short, although resources are very often scarce, resource allocation occurs differently during a pandemic. 

It is important to note that any discussion of resource allocation is incomplete without the appropriate historical, political, and geographical context. A truly just distribution would allocate resources according to some agreed-upon criterion, such as need or potential improvement in well-being and would strike a fair bargain between various countries and regions. In reality, resources are not distributed this way. Economic and political interests, to say nothing of long-standing imbalances of power, drive preferential access in times of scarcity. We therefore concern ourselves here with the non- ideal world in which we live; this is the world in which allocation decisions operate in times of crisis. A fuller account of the just distribution of resources might include the backdrop against which current allocation decisions are made, as well as whether recompense is owed for prior wrongs as part of allocation in a crisis, but we will bracket these issues for the time being.

## Macroallocation of Scarce Resources

Macroallocation centers on the larger dimension of healthcare needs across a society or multiple societies. Disparities in critical infrastructure and government functions are exacerbated in a pandemic in a way that raises questions of key moral importance. For instance, the rapidly increasing number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in countries like Morocco, Nigeria, and Armenia raises concerns about how each country will manage the impact COVID-19 will have on its health systems. Because the COVID-19 pandemic has already demonstrated the need for a highly interdependent global response, a widespread outbreak in low-to-middle income countries \(LMIC\) will not only impact their populations and health systems, but will also exacerbate problems with the interdigitated health and economic systems of the world. Thus, macroallocation considers how scarce resources can be provided to safeguard the well-being of countries with more constraints and fewer resources.

Macroallocation places particular emphasis on priority setting across a population, with a focus on **distributive justice** as the underlying moral aim. Distributive justice is concerned with the equal distribution of goods across or between societies. Principles of distributive justice, such as various forms of Egalitarianism, are “therefore best thought of as providing moral guidance for the political processes and structures that affect the distribution of benefits and burdens in societies” \([SEP](https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/justice-distributive/)\). In practice, these processes are operationalized by governments or the relevant authorities in the hopes of achieving the statistically best outcome with the underlying principles as guidance. It is critical to note that these principles do not exist on their own but should be consistent with societal norms and values to be effective.

In response to COVID-19, a number of organizations and institutions have established recommendations about priority-setting in various contexts. Some of these focus on the international setting. The Center for Disaster Philanthropy \([CDP](https://disasterphilanthropy.org/cdp-fund/cdp-covid-19-response-fund/)\) addresses questions regarding the distribution of general funding, such as philanthropic and high-GDP country support for low- and middle-income countries \(LMICs\) as they try to afford critical treatments. [USAid](https://www.usaid.gov/coronavirus) states that funds directed to the WHO will help governments in developing countries prepare for large-scale testing, implement public health emergency plans, and equip rapid response teams. What are the roles of high-income governments in supporting LMICs during a global pandemic, if the outcome would be orders of magnitude worse in LMICs? How much funding should well-off countries divert from their own domestic efforts to fight the spread of disease overseas?

There are also questions of differential access. The [WHO](https://www.who.int/influenza/preparedness/pandemic-vaccine-products/en/) has explored the question of whether countries will have differential access to a vaccine in the early days after development, before it is made in large enough quantities for all. Such actions can spark global controversies, as evidenced by reports of President Donald Trump’s attempt to buy exclusive rights to a German vaccine \([BMJ](https://www.bmj.com/content/368/bmj.m1100)\). Thus, we must question: Who will receive vaccines first? Does that distributive strategy prioritize fairness or power differentials? 

Domestically, the [United States Congress](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/06/812964894/where-that-8-3-billion-in-u-s-coronavirus-funding-will-and-wont-go) passed legislation that allocates funding for state and local health departments, pharmaceutical interventions, the NIH, and hospital reimbursement, as well as non-health needs such as educational and economic stabilization. These relative contributions to various sectors entail value-laden choices about how to prioritize, for instance, economic recovery or early disease control.

Individual values can influence how participants in macroallocation agreements view proceedings. The relative prioritization of values differs around the world. Unaddressed differences in ethical perspectives amongst participants can cause conflict and a failure to successfully implement policies. Macroallocation and the equitable distribution of resources therefore depends on a contract between stakeholders - to negotiate in good faith and seek to understand each other’s priorities and perspectives - in agree on fair resource allocation resources.

_Thought Question:_

* What are our responsibilities within our own country?  Should we feel responsible for the rest of the world? If so, how could we be of assistance?

## Microallocation

In what follows, we examine three situations that have arisen during the COVID-19 pandemic in which microallocation of scarce resources is necessary. All three scenarios share general practical strategies that seek to obtain more of the resource, use less of it, or stretch available resources further. These allocation questions involve direct trade-offs and often require choosing who from among various identifiable individuals will receive scarce resources. Furthermore, at a certain point, the available resources, no matter how agilely managed, will dissipate. How should these cases be managed? These situations will all require tough, morally laden choices. In much of the conversation here, we draw from the [Principles of Allocation](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-6-medical-ethics-in-relation-to-covid-19/overview-of-u.s.-medical-ethics#principles-of-allocation).

### **Allocating Personal Protective Equipment \(PPE\)**

As the case burden of COVID-19 continues to grow, supply shortages of PPE such as gowns, gloves, and masks have become increasingly acute. Governments and hospitals worldwide must ration scarce PPE reserves. In some cases, healthcare workers are being trained to [reuse PPE](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/respirators-strategy/contingency-capacity-strategies.html), [improvise their own gear](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/nation/what-are-surgical-masks-and-respirators-and-why-are-they-important-in-the-fight-against-covid-19), and sterilize or re-sanitize masks after completing shifts. If resource shortages continue to worsen, these individuals may be faced with a harrowing decision - do they work with substandard PPE, without PPE, or not at all? These decisions directly impact their own well-being as well as that of their patients.  


Where there is still adequate PPE, who should have priority access? Many sources, including [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/infection-prevention-and-control), [Strategic National Stockpile](https://www.esrdnetwork.org/sites/default/files/COVID-19%20Strategic%20National%20Stockpile%20PPE%20Distribution%20Information.pdf), [Ranney et al., 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2006141) believe that frontline healthcare workers and first responders should have priority . These individuals assume the critical mantle of treating patients and keeping the medical infrastructure intact and arguably the most instrumental value during a pandemic \([Emanuel et al. 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2005114)\). A utilitarian approach also supports conservation of PPE for these personnel. Medical personnel, if infected, may transmit the virus and infect others. If they fall ill or succumb to the disease, many patients - both with and without COVID-19 - will receive insufficient care with increases in morbidity and mortality. Prioritizing PPE for frontline workers mitigates their own health risks and avoids asking them to treat patients with COVID-19 at a potentially tremendous personal cost. 

There is some debate over how far the definition of “frontline” worker should extend. For example, [Partners Healthcare](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus/surgical_mask_policy) and Beth Israel Lahey Health, both in Boston, have mandated that all hospital personnel wear surgical masks on the premises, regardless of whether they directly interact with COVID-19 patients. One argument in support of this approach is that various staff who do not have direct patient care responsibilities \(e.g. hospital cleaning staff\) perform vital services in a pandemic by keeping hospitals running smoothly. Outside of the hospital, there is disagreement over whether “essential” workers such as [grocery store employees](https://www.brookings.edu/blog/the-avenue/2020/03/25/grocery-workers-are-keeping-americans-alive-during-the-covid-19-pandemic-heres-what-they-need/) should wear PPE. The CDC has stated that the general public, including supermarket employees, [do not](https://www.grocerydive.com/news/grocers-give-workers-the-ok-to-wear-masks-gloves/574897/) need to wear masks, though various locales in Massachusetts and elsewhere have [encouraged](https://necsi.edu/coronavirus-guide-for-supermarkets-grocery-stores-and-pharmacies) all grocery store workers to do so. This is in part a disagreement over who constitutes “essential” personnel and how far available resources can be stretched.

Another question is how aggressively PPE should be diverted from general use to these “essential” settings. Amid acute PPE shortages in many U.S. states, governors have reportedly been forced to engage in [bidding wars](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/31/us/governors-trump-coronavirus.html) to secure federal shipments of supplies to their respective states. The National Stockpile has already been [nearly depleted](https://www.cnn.com/2020/04/01/politics/national-stockpile-shipments/index.html) of protective gear, with few mechanisms in place to immediately replenish this emergency repository of medical supplies. However, the U.S. government has not yet issued any formal nationwide directive to consolidate and redistribute PPE to the frontlines of the pandemic. In recent weeks, agencies such as the [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/faq.html#protect) have discouraged the general public from purchasing and wearing medical masks in the interest of conserving these resources for healthcare workers. Yet this guidance has not directly prohibited large retailers from stocking and selling masks, including [N95 masks](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/04/01/business/n95-face-masks-home-depot-virus.html), to the public. Similarly, the [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services](https://www.cms.gov/newsroom/press-releases/cms-releases-recommendations-adult-elective-surgeries-non-essential-medical-surgical-and-dental) and professional societies like the [American College of Surgeons](https://www.facs.org/covid-19/clinical-guidance/elective-surgery) have appealed to healthcare providers to defer non-emergent medical procedures in the interest of conserving PPE, yet [not all medical centers](https://khn.org/news/some-hospitals-continue-with-elective-surgeries-despite-covid-19-crisis/) have adhered to these requests. Only in Oregon has PPE redistribution been formally legislated, with Governor Kate Brown issuing an [Executive Order](https://www.oregon.gov/gov/Documents/executive_orders/eo_20-10.pdf) requiring all healthcare providers in the state to donate surplus PPE for COVID-19 patient care. In the absence of a centralized approach that can direct these resources to where they are needed most, there has been a piecemeal response to the acquisition and provision of PPE. 

_Thought questions:_

* Do healthcare providers who lack adequate access to PPE continue to have an obligation to care for patients?
* Should governments compel individuals and businesses to donate PPE to “frontline” efforts? What ethical principles or other circumstances might factor into that decision?

### **Allocating COVID-19 testing kits**

Demand for COVID-19 diagnostic testing also continues to outpace supply in many countries. Worldwide, efforts to mass-produce test kits and augment testing volume have been stymied by shortages in [collection swabs](https://khn.org/news/as-coronavirus-testing-gears-up-specialized-swabs-running-out/) and [testing reagents](https://www.ecdc.europa.eu/sites/default/files/documents/RRA-seventh-update-Outbreak-of-coronavirus-disease-COVID-19.pdf), as well as [limitations](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2020/03/28/822869504/why-it-takes-so-long-to-get-most-covid-19-test-results) in laboratory processing capabilities. In the U.S., testing has also been handicapped by [multiple missteps](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/28/us/testing-coronavirus-pandemic.html) in the initial government response, including costly technical and regulatory delays in deploying working tests. Confronted with significant testing shortages, hospitals and public health agencies have devised guidelines stipulating which individuals merit access to testing over others \(examples: [WHO](https://www.who.int/emergencies/diseases/novel-coronavirus-2019/technical-guidance/laboratory-guidance), [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html), [Beth Israel Lahey Health](https://www.bilh.org/covid19-information-assets), [Brigham/Mass General](https://pulse.partners.org/hub/departments/emergency_preparedness/coronavirus/covid19_testing_criteria) - access credentials required\). These guidelines aim to use available testing kits in the most efficacious manner by triaging who receives testing. 

Among most guidelines, two groups consistently emerge as top priorities for testing: **patients** with COVID-19 symptoms who require hospitalization, and **healthcare workers** who are directly caring for them. Patients who are hospitalized for presumptive COVID-19 tend to be the sickest and often have significant medical comorbidities. From a prioritarian perspective, these individuals should be tested first because they face the highest risk of morbidity and mortality from the disease, and are thus considered as the worst off \([Emanuel et al. 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2005114)\). Ascertaining a diagnosis is paramount in guiding the next steps of their care, whereas it is far less critical for someone with mild disease recovering at home. According to many guidelines, members of the general public who are asymptomatic or who exhibit mild symptoms are currently lower priority for testing \([CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/hcp/clinical-criteria.html)\), particularly in areas where existing testing capacity is already inundated by cases from hospitalized patients. In these settings, it has become increasingly difficult to test many suspected cases of mild community-acquired COVID-19, to preemptively test close contacts of infected individuals, or to monitor local spread of the virus in real time, all of which are important public health goals \([Emanuel et al., 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsb2005114)\). Thus, the current approach to prioritize testing of high-acuity patients over lower-acuity ones achieves certain valuable goals at the expense of others. These are the tradeoffs inherent in resource allocation, and highlight the importance of developing broad, communally-accessible testing. 

A different rationale guides the preferential testing of frontline healthcare workers. They are at elevated risk of contracting and transmitting the virus yet have instrumental value in the response to a pandemic, and therefore require frequent testing in order to be able to function effectively and avoid contaminating others. Some have argued that this approach should extend to other personnel, such as [first responders](https://www.chicagotribune.com/suburbs/aurora-beacon-news/ct-abn-aurora-first-responders-covid-19-testing-st-0327-20200326-64kn7zcykje4zoeglvcug7orxq-story.html), who have assumed similarly indispensable duties and risks during the pandemic. It is less clear how to optimally balance the testing of hospitalized patients with that of essential personnel in the setting of acute test kit shortages. If many hospitalized patients remain untested, this may affect appropriate triaging of care and lead to unnecessary consumption of already-scarce PPE. Alternatively, if many essential personnel remain untested, they may be unnecessarily sidelined by mandatory quarantining or serve as vectors for infection, exacerbating healthcare and first responder staffing shortages.

It is unclear how consistently testing allocation schemes have been observed in practice. In the U.S., a number of prominent figures \(e.g. [members of Congress](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/22/us/politics/coronavirus-rand-paul.html), [NBA players](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/17/sports/brooklyn-nets-coronavirus.html)\) have been tested for COVID-19 despite being asymptomatic. One could argue that these individuals possess instrumental value \(such as leadership or media influence during a pandemic\) or associated risk factors \(such as essential travel and extensive close contacts\) that necessitate their testing. However, if the notion of “instrumental value” is broadened to this extent, this could arguably privilege the interests of the powerful and well-connected over the needs of the general public. 

_Thought questions:_

* Given the current scarcity of diagnostic tests, communities will likely have differential access to early testing. How might disparities in access to early tests shape how the pandemic affects these communities in the long run?

### **Lifesaving interventions**

At the crux of resource allocation issues in a pandemic is who should have access to lifesaving interventions when they are in limited supply. That reality is most acute when it comes to life-saving interventions such as ventilators and extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation \(ECMO\) technology, as allocation decisions directly and acutely lead to saving certain lives while not saving others. These issues can be intensely personal for clinicians; it may be perceived as a failing if some patients die as a result of choices made on their watch. The current pandemic casts these choices into the sharpest relief. In what follows, we review several situations that could conceivably arise during the current pandemic in which the allocation of life-saving interventions is necessary. Our goal is not to reach conclusions here about the right choices to make in these cases. Rather, by highlighting various allocation issues that may arise, we hope to prepare readers for the possibility - or even the inevitability - that they will be called on to make those decisions or to support those who do. 

There is a critical need for ventilators in the current pandemic. Why is that the case? It is a result of two key features of the disease: patients with COVID-19 require intubation early, and for long periods of time. Usually, when a patient’s respiratory status is declining, there is a step-wise approach that gradually increases the invasiveness of the interventions they receive. However, several intermediate steps in that pathway - the use of nebulizer treatments, humidified oxygen therapy \(e.g., high-flow nasal cannula\) and BIPAP machines - are felt to be unsafe, as they are thought to aerosolize SARS-CoV-2 particles and place healthcare workers at risk. Many hospitals therefore skip directly to the intubation of any and all patients with COVID-19 who are in respiratory distress. Furthermore, patients who require mechanical ventilation need that support for an unusually long period of time - an average of two weeks. This is in contrast to the clinical course for most pneumonias \(such as those caused by influenza\), in which many patients’ clinical status improves after several days on a ventilator. Thus, ventilators cannot be repurposed easily or after a short period of time. 

A number of important ethical questions arise proximal to and around the question of who should get a ventilator. First, should ventilators be shared? New York State has started to [share](https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/26/health/coronavirus-ventilator-sharing.html?action=click&module=Top%20Stories&pgtype=Homepage) or ‘split’ ventilators between multiple patients. A tube is placed to split the output of the ventilator so it can, in theory, treat multiple patients. The downside to this approach is that a ventilator can be set to only one setting, whereas patients usually require highly-individualized settings that are fine-tuned by trial-and-error in the ICU to deliver optimal pulmonary support. Therefore, patients may not receive ideal care. The aim is to find patients who require similar settings, so that both receive at least appropriate care. However, this has never been rigorously tested in humans and is primarily a theoretical idea up to this point. The advantage of this approach is that it may be able to save more lives. The downside is that a larger number of patients may have worse outcomes, if they are all receiving treatments that are less efficacious as compared to typical standard of care for respiratory failure. Do the benefits of this approach outweigh the risks? The principle of non-maleficence suggests that clinicians should avoid causing harm to their patients. A corollary is that care is inappropriate if it is provided below a certain accepted standard. Non-maleficence opposes the splitting of ventilators as it means that some patients - who might survive if they were the only one on a ventilator - might suffer worse outcomes as a result and would therefore be harmed. This value is in tension with the idea of beneficence, which supports any attempt to save more lives. How should this tension be resolved? A common strategy is to turn to consequentialist approaches such as QALYs or DALYs to see which strategy has the greater expected net benefit. Other approaches hold that certain moral principles, such as nonmaleficence, carry greater moral weight given their relative centrality in the medical profession’s canon \(e.g. ‘do no harm’ supersedes an affirmative obligation to heal\). 

Second, should some patients not even be offered a ventilator? Some patients may arrive at the ED extremely sick, and a triage decision is made that they have a very low likelihood of survival due to multiple comorbidities or clinical status. Should these patients be offered ICU care with a ventilator? Once care is offered, it is difficult to revoke. Withdrawing life-sustaining care is typically done at a patient or family’s request, or for reasons of medical futility. In contrast, during a pandemic, rationing may require the withdrawal of care in order to provide ventilators to patients who are given higher priority, a reason that may be foreign to many front-line clinicians \(Truog et al, NEJM 2020\) This raises the question of when that decision should be initiated. If it is apparent to ED clinicians that a particular patient, if intubated, would likely be removed from a ventilator in the near future because they are very sick and consequently lower priority, should they even offer mechanical ventilation as an option? If some patients will not be offered the option of aggressive care, when is that decision made, and who conveys it? These questions are likely to arise as an increasing number of precipitously ill patients arrive at the hospital. 

Third, who gets a ventilator? If there are not enough ventilators for all patients, some patients will receive them while others will not. This will require tough decisions as to which patients may be saved. These allocation decisions can be made with a variety of ethical frameworks and principles in mind. An excellent approach to thinking through allocation decisions is provided above \(See: [Principles of Allocation](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-6-medical-ethics-in-relation-to-covid-19/overview-of-u.s.-medical-ethics#principles-of-allocation)\). Thus in this section we will limit ourselves to saying that decisions are often not standardized across institutions and may reflect local context. In contrast, the principles above are felt to be universal. 

Finally, who should decide who gets a ventilator? There are various options. Some have suggested that clinicians intimately involved in the care of the patients in question should make those decisions - an approach known as ‘bedside rationing’. Such decisions can be fraught with bias as well as emotional entanglements with particular patients \(e.g. ‘this patient reminds me of so-and-so’\), and as a result can inflict a toll on clinical staff. In an effort to standardize allocation decisions and obviate the distress to frontline staff, there is a move for hospital committees to make allocation decisions \(See Truog, et al NEJM 2020\). Hospital committees, consisting of doctors, various other clinical staff, and administrators, would meet and review cases. One clear advantage of this approach is that it allows for involvement of various stakeholder views including that of ‘community representatives’. It may obviate the distress of bedside clinicians, but may also make them feel that life-or-death decisions about their patients have been taken out of their hands. 

_Thought Questions:_

* If you had to allocate ventilator spots to a panel of patients, how would you decide? What criteria would you consider important, and why? 
* When have you seen life-saving care rationed in the hospital on clinical rotations? 

## Real-World Example

On April 7, 2020, the Commonwealth of Massachusetts released Crisis Standards of Care [recommendations](https://d279m997dpfwgl.cloudfront.net/wp/2020/04/CSC_April-7_2020.pdf). These guidelines are primarily grounded in **utilitarian** principles: they seek to save the most lives and life-years.  They do so by using clinical scoring criteria to identify patients most likely to benefit from critical care services.  

In the days after these recommendations' release, [public servants](https://www.wbur.org/commonhealth/2020/04/14/ayanna-pressley-critical-care-state-guidance-governor-letter) and [providers](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScxjXDKBrI8K2PC4eApInU-g8z9OIDcx4mexsmNeFhbTuX7Qg/viewform) taking a more **prioritarian** view pushed back, arguing that "giving priority to those without serious comorbid illness, will disproportionately discriminate against vulnerable populations by serving as a proxy for race, ethnicity, immigration status, serious mental illness, and other sociodemographic characteristics."  

_Thought Questions:_

* Some of these concerns are addressed in this [video](https://harvard.zoom.us/rec/play/78cuJr-oqT83HYaSsgSDAvV5W420J6yshycd_qcPnRrkUnICZ1P0MOcXa-dpX6Ohuuv_iCFOEnq51ifk?continueMode=true&_x_zm_rtaid=mr94-yfqRBeuOPt2jGvdQw.1586961053268.f2d6f3952872cdf123b2a8b1b2482f1f&_x_zm_rhtaid=839) recording of Surgical Grand Rounds at April 15, 2020, at the Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center.  What do you make of Dr. Kristin Raven’s assessment at 44:16 that “unfortunately in a time of crisis, we can’t also make up for those longstanding disparities in care... certainly an important thing that needs to be taken into consideration after crisis standards”?
