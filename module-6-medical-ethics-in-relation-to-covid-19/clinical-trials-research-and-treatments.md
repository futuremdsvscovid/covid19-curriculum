# Clinical Trials, Research, and Treatments

## Overview

As COVID-19 spreads, scientists are developing pharmaceuticals and vaccines that might treat the disease. While everyone hopes for a rapid discovery, the quest to identify therapeutics and prove their efficacy raises important ethical considerations. Furthermore, the interests of patients, the scientific community, the general public, and government officials may conflict.

_Thought questions:_

* What are the main ethical considerations in carrying out medical research on human populations? 
* How are these considerations challenged in times of crisis, and how does a society balance the needs of the population while maintaining core ethical principles that protect human study subjects?

## What Makes an Ethical Research Trial Design?

Over the course of modern medical history, the use of human subjects in research studies has undergone substantial ethical regulation and reform. In the U.S., efforts to reform research guidelines culminated in the National Research Act of 1974 and the resulting [Belmont Report](https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/regulations-and-policy/belmont-report/read-the-belmont-report/index.html), which outlines three core and legally actionable principles of human research: respect for persons, beneficence, and justice. The principle of **respect for persons** involves determining capacity and informed consent, as well as protecting autonomy and privacy of the individual. **Beneficence** encompasses ensuring treatments and studies are beneficial to patients and society in comparison to the risks undertaken. Finally, the principle of **justice** protects vulnerable populations while equally distributing benefits.

While the Belmont Report provides important standards for ethical clinical research design, some have pointed out that these principles are too broad. To this end, bioethicists at the NIH Clinical Center published seven [criteria](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/guiding-principles-ethical-research) that ensure that the above three principles are met. These criteria are deemed necessary for ethical clinical research:

1. **Respect for potential and enrolled subjects --** allow subjects to withdraw, protect privacy, inform subjects of newly discovered risks or benefits, inform subjects of results of clinical research, maintain welfare of subjects
2. **Informed consent --** provision of information to subjects about purposes of the research, its procedures, potential risks, benefits, and alternatives, so that the individual understands and can make voluntary decisions
3. **Social or scientific value --** evaluation of treatment, intervention, or theory will improve health and well-being or increase knowledge
4. **Scientific validity --** use of accepted scientific principles and methods, including statistical techniques, to produce reliable and valid data ****
5. **Favorable risk-benefit ratio --** minimization of risks, enhancement of potential benefits, risks to the subject are proportionate to benefits to the subject and society
6. **Independent review --** review of the design of the research trial, its proposed subject population, and risk-benefit ratio by individuals unaffiliated with the research
7. **Fair subject selection --** selection of subjects so that stigmatized and vulnerable individuals are not targeted for risky research and the rich and socially powerful are not favored for potentially beneficial research

## Challenges to the Principle of Respect for Persons

### **Providing informed consent:** 

Even under ordinary circumstances, ensuring proper informed consent can be difficult, as the term may be interpreted in different ways. In 1979, American philosophers Beauchamp and Childress offered one definition of informed consent that is still referenced: “an individual’s autonomous authorization of a medical intervention or of participation in research.” According to these philosophers, informed consent entails more than agreeing to a study. It must involve authorizing an act through the act of voluntary consent. In particular, Beauchamp and Childress stated that the following seven elements are thought to capture informed consent: 

1. **Threshold Elements \(Preconditions\)**
   1. Competence \(to understand and decide\)
   2. Voluntariness \(in deciding\)
2. **Information Elements**
   1. Disclosure \(of material information\)
   2. Recommendation \(of a plan\)
   3. Understanding \(of Disclosure and Recommendation\)
3. **Consent Elements**
   1. Decision \(in favor of a plan\)
   2. Authorization \(of the chosen plan\)

As we understand these elements that comprise informed consent, it begins to become clear how conditions of crisis may place constraints on these principles. In the context of the current COVID-19 pandemic, there are already a number of clinical trials underway, from testing antiviral drugs to vaccine trials to evaluating passive antibody transfer \(see [Modules 1](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/module-1-from-bench-to-bedside/investigational-therapeutics-and-vaccine-development) for more information regarding ongoing trials\). Given the rapid spread of COVID-19, many of these trials do not have preliminary data on the risks of treatments for human subjects. While some therapeutics, such as the anti-malarial drug hydroxychloroquine, have been FDA-approved and are being [tested on COVID-19 patients](https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/03/30/coronavirus-drugs-hydroxychloroquin-chloroquine/), these medications may have significant toxic side effects. Given the unknown risks of new or unproven treatments for COVID-19, how does a researcher ensure that a potential study participant has received appropriate disclosure, and how does a researcher assess a potential study participant’s understanding of the risks of participating? 

Another ethical challenge that surrounds the issue of informed consent is determining whether severely ill COVID-19 patients may have the capacity to agree to clinical trials or experimental therapies. It has been reported that, after the initial onset of dyspnea, many [COVID-19 patients rapidly deteriorate](https://www.uptodate.com/contents/coronavirus-disease-2019-covid-19) and develop Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome \(ARDS\). Given the possible sudden decline in respiratory function in this subset of patients, many individuals may not have the opportunity to designate a health care proxy \(if they had none prior\). Thus for recent, expedited trials such as the [convalescent plasma study](https://www.fda.gov/vaccines-blood-biologics/investigational-new-drug-ind-or-device-exemption-ide-process-cber/investigational-covid-19-convalescent-plasma-emergency-inds), it may be difficult to determine whether patients who are severely sick would agree to be part of the research trial.

## **Challenges to the Principle of Beneficence**

One of the key questions raised by COVID-19 research trials is the balance between risks to human subjects and potentially life-saving treatments that can help the rest of society? This is not the first disease in recent history for which this ethical question has been posed. During the AIDS crisis in the 1980s, as well as Ebola and Zika epidemics of the past decade, there were similar pressures to expedite research studies to find vaccines or therapeutics. Even in non-pandemic scenarios, experimental drugs developed for terminal illnesses may be fast-tracked to help critically ill patients. Here, we will discuss some of the adaptations in research guidelines that are made in situations where time is even more limited, as well as the risks and benefits of these different standards.

### **Phases of clinical trials**

There are [four phases](https://www.nih.gov/health-information/nih-clinical-research-trials-you/basics) of clinical trials: 

* _Phase 1:_ Test drug or treatment in a small group of people \(20-80\) for the first time. The goal of this phase is to learn about safety and identify side effects.
* _Phase 2:_ Drug or treatment is given to a larger group of people \(100-300\). The goal of this phase is to determine efficacy and further identify safety risks. 
* _Phase 3:_ Drug or treatment is given to an even larger group of volunteers \(1,000-3,000\) to confirm effectiveness, monitor side effects, and compare to the standard of care or similar treatments. The treatment may be approved by the FDA if this phase succeeds.
* _Phase 4:_ After the drug or treatment is made available to the public, researchers track safety in the general population and seek information from patients about benefits, optimal use, and side effects.

The volunteers used for a clinical trial depend on researchers’ inclusion/exclusion criteria, including age, gender, type and stage of disease, treatment history, and other medical conditions. It may take years for a treatment to become FDA-approved, and many fail in the earliest phases.

### **Approving off-label treatments**

Even after a therapeutic is FDA-approved, the treatment cannot be used to treat any medical condition. According to the FDA, [“off-label”](https://www.fda.gov/patients/learn-about-expanded-access-and-other-treatment-options/understanding-unapproved-use-approved-drugs-label) refers to the unapproved use of a drug or treatment approved for a different use. During times of crisis, there is often an increased impetus to use medications approved for similar illnesses in the hopes that this previously FDA-approved therapeutic may be beneficial. In the context of the COVID-19 pandemic, the antimalarial agent hydroxychloroquine provides an example of an off-label drug being tested.

The FDA guidelines for “off-label” use of drugs approved for another purpose leave discretion to the individual treating physician, with oversight by local institutions, including its Institutional Review Boards \(IRBs\). The FDA [explains](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/label-and-investigational-use-marketed-drugs-biologics-and-medical-devices), _“Good medical practice and the best interests of the patient require that physicians use legally available drugs, biologics and devices according to their best knowledge and judgement.”_ A physician’s responsibilities in using an approved product in such a way are three-fold:

1\) awareness of the product and its effects  
2\) use based on “firm scientific rationale and sound medical evidence"  
3\) keeping a record of the drug’s usage and its effects. 

While the off-label use of FDA-approved drugs and therapies is less stringently regulated, the testing of experimental drugs, therapies, and devices currently in the U.S. is bound by the Health and Human Service \(HHS\) Common Rule and FDA guidelines to ensure proper beneficence of any new drug or therapy. While a harmonized ruleset is currently expected, the expectation is that the more stringent and protective ruleset be followed by investigators. 

### **Expediting FDA approval of treatments for experimental use**

Despite the increased use of off-label drugs to treat COVID-19, the reality is that, because this virus emerged so rapidly, there are few FDA-approved treatment options. Although many companies are racing to develop vaccines or develop antiviral agents similar to those used to treat Ebola or SARS, these new therapeutics could remain on hold while undergoing a normal clinical trial timeline. The FDA does, however, have a process for the expedited approval of therapeutics to treat critical illnesses.

There are currently five tiers of approval tracks for emergency and expedited FDA approval of any investigational new drug \(IND\), including vaccines. These encompass the treatment of a serious disease, [defined](https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/Expedited-Programs-for-Serious-Conditions-Drugs-and-Biologics.pdf) as:

> “a disease or condition associated with morbidity that has substantial impact on day-to-day functioning. Short-lived and self-limiting morbidity will usually not be sufficient, but the morbidity need not be irreversible if it is persistent or recurrent. Whether a disease or condition is serious is a matter of clinical judgment, based on its impact on such factors as survival, day-to-day functioning, or the likelihood that the disease, if left untreated, will progress from a less severe condition to a more serious one.”

The four tracks of expedited review are Fast Track, Breakthrough Therapy, Accelerated Approval, and Priority Review. The qualifying criteria are noted in the table [below](https://www.fda.gov/files/drugs/published/Expedited-Programs-for-Serious-Conditions-Drugs-and-Biologics.pdf). The FDA has 60 calendar days to review and approve such applications. Given that COVID-19 meets criteria for a serious disease and has unmet medical needs, drugs and therapies to treat COVID-19 qualify for Fast Track review. 

![](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/MdCloR6iFMrIx8T6Xl0zbTVGq2mM4-t3bf0y-KusmOc1MYrd4jVZdmBK_xu7Qm36KZj82fm7bCl4MBIbrBWeYaG-ifMQcL9of9UohAmdgGEfWkQzFRn73EEje_e4jFXFczNDgKQG)

A Fast Track designation allows for FDA facilitation of the IND application, including more immediate access to FDA communications to ensure efficient and appropriate data collection and rolling review of applications without full completion of the entire application.

Additionally, for emergency situations that have received designation as such by the Secretary for HHS, the FDA can grant an [Emergency Use Authorization \(EUA\)](https://www.fda.gov/regulatory-information/search-fda-guidance-documents/emergency-use-authorization-medical-products-and-related-authorities) for any drug or device before full FDA approval. The requirements for use under an EUA are less stringent:

> 1\) the agent can cause a serious or life-threatening disease or condition;
>
> 2\) it is reasonable to believe, based on the totality of the scientific evidence available, that:
>
> a\) The product may be effective \(vs. having demonstrated effectiveness\) in diagnosing, treating, or preventing the disease or condition caused by the BCRN agent; and
>
> b\) The known and potential benefits of the product outweigh the known and potential risks; and
>
> 3\) there is no adequate, approved, and available alternative to the product.

It is possible that any new drug or vaccine under investigation for COVID-19 would be approved for EUA use, especially if the designated risk category is “minimal.” COVID-19 received emergency designation by the HHS secretary on [February 4, 2020](https://crsreports.congress.gov/product/pdf/LSB/LSB10427), and has multiple instances of EUA approval, first for the use of yet unapproved diagnostic tests and a second for the use of yet unapproved PPE.

### **Ethics of vaccine development**

We will now focus on ethical questions specific to vaccine development. Below is a comparison of traditional vaccine development timelines versus that in a pandemic. Some of the main differences involve the parallelization of the steps seen normally, which reduces time while increasing risk for developers \([Lurie et al., 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630)\). Despite the condensed timelines, many of the recent vaccine development efforts for outbreaks such as Ebola, Zika, and MERS were not completed in a time frame relevant for intervention in their respective epidemics. 

![Difference between Traditional Vaccine Development and Development Using a Pandemic Paradigm](https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/vgMk-3dGYLh5BHoFX5y2jRI355uz-sWG9a4S85aaAD3ZD9DVG7ilehwaw5puvLr2W-C5KImK-cglzO-W2XwIYQqebzJgiw0gGmsyDYKpP9hhrO44Q2rkihRp5-XdXVhFOBPVh1Mn)

To achieve optimally time efficient vaccine development, intentional infectious inoculation of human subjects is one of many methods to obtain efficacy data. These studies, known as **vaccine challenge experiments**, are substantially more expedient compared to natural infection studies, making them useful during time-sensitive pandemics. However, given that these trials require deliberate inoculation of healthy volunteers, thorough and careful ethical consideration is warranted, particularly when exposing subjects to diseases with significant risk of morbidity and mortality, and in scenarios with no treatment options.

For these human challenge trials, an ethical review is deemed essential, particularly to assess the risks of exposure versus the benefit of data, as well as the robustness of informed consent. These trials are truly an arena in which the considerations of beneficence \(risk versus benefit\), respect for persons \(informed consent and true understanding of potential risks by studied individuals\), and justice \(ensuring fair population recruitment for risk burden\) must be carefully balanced. For this reason, human challenge trials are not acceptable in vulnerable populations, particularly those that cannot give clear informed consent \([WHO, 2016](https://www.who.int/biologicals/expert_committee/Human_challenge_Trials_IK_final.pdf)\). However, these trials have been performed in specific circumstances. For example, in a recent NIH [malaria vaccine trial](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT02015091), the benefits of the study were determined acceptable relative to the risk of infection, particularly allowing for treatment and monitoring of the exposed group. As a counterexample, a human challenge study for a Zika vaccine was not conducted due to increased risk to potential non-consenting individuals \(i.e., sexual partners of participants, fetuses\) \([Callaway, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00927-3#ref-CR1)\). 

Given that no treatments for COVID-19 exist, in addition to chance of morbidity and non-negligible chance of mortality, the discussion around a potential human challenge trial, which would expedite efficacy data collection, has only just begun to weigh the risks to the experimental population versus the benefits of the population as a whole \([Callaway, 2020](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-020-00927-3#ref-CR1), [Eyal et al., 2020](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/42639016)\). Further, even the fundamental design of a randomized clinical trial can be problematic in diseases with significant morbidity and mortality with regards to the placebo control arm. For example, during the Ebola vaccine efficacy trials, it was deemed unethical to employ placebo for control. Alternative methods were sought, including the use of early and delayed phase vaccination groups to determine efficacy. Design of efficacy trials for SARS-CoV-2 are currently being discussed \([Lurie et al., 2020](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMp2005630)\).

## **Challenges to the Principle of Justice**

The principle of justice is to ensure that those who bear the risks of research benefit from it and, correspondingly, those who benefit from research should bear some risk. Vulnerable and stigmatized populations should be protected from exploitation, and privileged groups should not be favored. 

There are many examples from U.S. history that illustrate threats to this ethical principle during wartime and in epidemics. In the 18th century, [Edward Jenner and Benjamin Waterhouse](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1200696/) tested smallpox vaccines on children, and [Thomas Jefferson](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/thomas-jefferson-conducted-early-smallpox-vaccine-trials-180954146/) conducted preliminary inoculation studies on his domestic enslaved persons. During the Spanish-American War, volunteers amongst American soldiers and recent Spanish immigrants to Cuba were [exposed to yellow fever](https://watermark.silverchair.com/milmed-d-12-00430.pdf?token=AQECAHi208BE49Ooan9kkhW_Ercy7Dm3ZL_9Cf3qfKAc485ysgAAAm0wggJpBgkqhkiG9w0BBwagggJaMIICVgIBADCCAk8GCSqGSIb3DQEHATAeBglghkgBZQMEAS4wEQQMB3Zx7LRFKBsB_g6tAgEQgIICIHASDNTou3CvY_DKwUl78YEIe7gHqJAIpW_aHliaI8RoO2GO8ihYcrOGvnNUn3uZG3lWjtmUYfYNFcW4ZntHvkzt0hrBEzCIdqtlLA58seDoRhPg5yqDL1v-0FmN8wLzZsjrvtcxDgMKmS8huItPK4t0bEtkFI2z4GOwjqYxcc-gnhOWT3lR2tYKnoq6MeXANnG2gR0zemHqj2XA_iQbvK9zxser8U4moPYqd7hz8h1aKHvD4r_w5kbIGLtV2rmJnCAQUkMCv1h8EUEpM-hzKqaquRLiVl9pS10QuqsEnzwVaPDaWORnOz6NSad3HtuSk8Cyf3zbSQo_w3Ld4IIx6v-Ks0fAo8YVmj0w6fCELzW0m9BXStA2ZTSIDqnRzbLq8xp7cMaM7HU2jz3mtOG2-nL2guJDWQ78R9v1hRRbxvmx3k9JogqryLeZijvW4iCcJgcGj54sVBVkmavtxdCSFONVRQ7MHe3P_CNklcHB2E_F7EDlJEU6RisRl6Y6qUI3bF9xLMBflUvSjNC3Okv1nK4_mV1aSImP6jfDPSHOjqY-oqCj_4J6UXGe7R8G2Cnxc0ERQdlnmgmvYEK7dDBvdmp0bQIgOHf5ECIWcBxCwqpozbjv7ovvyIt7rm2xYqEWAhITze10fOu9_vbnaohGka4y7QqhE-yUbmlzNLUAt1xcOEonAzW10IV2njohlSzOQohPdrWWzQV-_WKc3vGRtYk) to better understand the methods of transmission of yellow fever, a disease that ravaged the U.S. army. The infamous [Tuskegee Syphilis Experiment](https://www.cdc.gov/tuskegee/timeline.htm), conducted from the 1930s to 1970s, actively deceived black patients by withholding standard-of-care treatments for decades to study the progression of the disease in these individuals. At the [Terre Haute U.S. penitentiary](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3828982/), researchers infected federal inmates with gonorrhea to test the effectiveness of post-exposure prophylaxis, a treatment they hoped to provide to affected American soldiers. In the 1950s, at [Willowbrook State School](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3952423), a school specifically for children with intellectual disabilities and where many children developed hepatitis after arrival due to overcrowded conditions, a research study was conducted to test the effectiveness of the novel treatment gamma-globulin. Some of these children were given the treatment and then deliberately infected with hepatitis.

It is crucial to ensure that vulnerable populations are not targeted at the expense of rapid scientific discoveries, as has occurred in the past. While many of these clinical trials are recruiting volunteers, this practice may not be as equitable as it sounds. Take, for instance, passive antibody transfer studies. Even though antibodies are being isolated from the plasma of patients who volunteer for the study, COVID-19 does not affect individuals equally. Patients from more vulnerable populations, such as the elderly living in crowded nursing homes or the homeless, are at greater risk of COVID-19 exposure and infection. These individuals may represent a greater proportion of study participants. As [the Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2020/03/two-extreme-long-shots-could-save-us-coronavirus/608539/) pointed out in a recent article, there are no guidelines on who would own potentially therapeutic antibodies -- will the patients from whom these antibodies were obtained be able to choose to immunize loved ones, or might the rich be able to buy the plasma of the poor who were previously infected? Furthermore, if compensation is offered to increase the participation, particularly for vaccine trials, which typically require a large number of participants, will this bias for subjects of lower socio-economic background? People in the U.S. cannot receive financial compensation for donating blood or organs, but they can be compensated for plasma harvested eggs, and harvested sperm. When might compensation be considered coercive, limiting an individual’s ability to make a voluntary choice?
