# Summary

## Cases

The situation around the world continues to evolve rapidly. For individuals like [**Brian** and **Diane**](https://curriculum.covidstudentresponse.org/curriculum-overview/cases#case-1-brian) the ethical questions and challenges are different and constantly changing. For instance, given her older age and general condition, Diane is worried that she will not have access to a ventilator if she needs one. Brian is concerned about whether the government is ethically justified in imposing strict public health measures. Both understand how ethically complex many decisions around COVID-19 are, and empathize with physicians and policymakers who need to grapple with them daily. As the disease continues to spread, they wonder whether their perspectives will also need to change, and realize that the field of ethics is constantly evolving based on context.

**Diane** is afraid about what will happen if she tests positive for COVID-19. Given her age and other health conditions, would she not be given access to a ventilator over someone else younger and healthier? What are some of the ethical frameworks to approach resource allocation, especially during a public health crisis?

**Brian** has many friends and family who have pre-existing health conditions. In addition, as part of his community service work in college, he visited a prison and worked on a literacy project. He remembers one prisoner in particular, whose name was Dan. Dan was in his mid-20s and suffered from type I diabetes. Brian wonders how this pandemic is affecting Dan and his ability to obtain his diabetes medications.

**Diane's** daughter is a respiratory therapist at a New York hospital that is now recommending its healthcare workers to wear their face mask for one week at a time. Her daughter wants to "do the right thing" but is nervous she will now not see Diane for months. Diane wonders how many other healthcare workers are in similar situations, and what the "right thing" to do is.

**Brian** thinks back to his canceled trip and original plans for after graduation. While he understands the importance of social distancing, he is unsure whether the government is ethically justified to impose such stringent public health measures. What are the ethical considerations in the field of public health, especially as they relate to infectious disease outbreaks?

## Final Thoughts

We hope this module helped capture the ethical complexity of COVID-19. We recognize this moduleâ€™s bias towards U.S. biomedical ethics and are working on subsequent chapters that will include additional frameworks prevalent throughout the world. Nonetheless, we think many of the ethical questions are universal, and we encourage you to think closely about the presented themes as the pandemic grows.
